<p>You could also look into becoming a warehouse manager, forklift driving trainer or forklift truck engineer. Telescopic forward reach allows you to unload lorries from one side so no forklift movement around the other side of the lorry is required, ensuring pedestrians stay safe and separate. In the 1940s, forklifts became even easier to use, thanks to batteries that drivers could recharge.</p>

It turns out that lifted trucks do more than just look cool — this modification brings some key benefits.

Four fixed-fork order pickers are ideally suited for picking bulky, oversized items or where extended platforms and industrial carts are used in place of pallets. If you need the forklift to operate under a fixed height structure, such as a container door then you should also consider the collapsed height of the mast.</p>

However, industrial-grade masts do reportedly provide more substantial lifting capacity at height, with 6,000-lb and 8,000-lb capacity lifts serving as two popular examples among a number of rental houses.</p>
