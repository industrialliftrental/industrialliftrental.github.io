<p>Forklift is a small industrial vehicle, having a power operated forked platform attached at the front that can be raised and lowered for insertion under a cargo to lift or move it. Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities. Our wide range includes Standard Forks (540 mm), narrow forks (450 mm) wide forks (685 mm) super wide forks (800 mm, 1000 mm) short, long & super long forks (900 mm, 1150 mm, 1220 mm, 1500 mm, 1800 mm, 2500 mm) in minimum fork heights of 36 mm, 51 mm, 75 mm & 85 mm. We offer finish such as painted, powder coated, galvanised, pallet trucks of special materials such as stainless steel.</p>
<p>Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines. Rough terrain forklifts help your crew move materials, supplies, and workers safely. Hand trucks lift the load a few inches off the ground, so they meant to be carrying things for long distances or extended periods.</p>
<p>All types and sizes, perfect for any need, including warehouse, material handling, outdoor and rough terrain. Designed to push through the toughest work days, these forklifts offer dependable performance and rugged durability in heavy-duty outdoor applications. Despite being used, all of our rough terrain forklifts are of a high standard. A reach truck looks like a very small type of counterbalance forklift.</p>
<h2>Common Causes Of Construction Accidents Fort Oglethorpe </h2>
<p>The extra-long frame combined with a larger counterweight means this model can handle larger loads. Coupled with the height of the equipment, an imaginary pyramid that stretches from the wheelbase to the lifting area of the machinery is what determines the equipment's stability. When leaving a powered industrial truck unattended, load engaging means shall be fully lowered, controls shall be neutralized, power shut off, brakes set, key of connector plug removed.</p>
<p>Counterbalanced forklifts are weighted at the rear to prevent the vehicle from tipping forward when lifting a load. Moving mast reach forklifts have a higher ground clearance due to larger wheels, but are unable to handle double deep racking responsibilities without a fork extension attachment. If these tests are used to determine capacity or alternate rated capacities, use appropriate loads and load centers instead of those herein specified.</p>

<p>The Neos II 14 - 16 - 20 ac reach trucks with retractable mast are the best products of their kind available on the market and can provide maximum performance under any operating conditions.
