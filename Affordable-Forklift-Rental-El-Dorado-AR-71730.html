<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? It tracks the global Pallet Trucks market across key regions, and offers in-depth commentary and accurate quantitative insights. Overall, a sit-down forklift is the right call for operations that need several hours of forklift work a day, or need to put their operator's comfort, safety, and accessibility first. Talk to us anytime about what you would like to achieve regarding your business material handling requirements so we are able to help you with a solution that will best meet your needs and budget.</p>
<p>While a side loader can measure less than five feet wide to fit into narrow spaces, a counterbalance forklift may need up to 13 feet to easily turn and maneuver through aisles. Your 4×4 truck can be your ticket to off-road adventures, your daily driver around town, your hauling and towing machine, or your work truck. If everything looks sound, place the pallet jack in a designed storage area, with the handle locked in a raised position.</p>

<p>Flexibility is perhaps the greatest benefit to renting a forklift versus buying. Polyurethane tires are incompatible with outdoor terrain and are therefore only installed on electric lifts that are used on smooth interior pavements and loading pads. Fork lift truck certification is required: Counter Balance, Raymond Reach, Order Picker and Pallet Truck. If you lift a load too high, you can cause the forklift to tip over.</p>
<p>Forklifts can unload pallets of bricks, construction materials and steel joists from the delivery truck and transport them to the job site. Powered by a lithium-ion battery, this electric pallet truck offers up to 3 hours of use. Ultimately, spending money on buying a used forklift will result in business growth and will set your mind at peace that it has been tested in its previous workplace.</p>
