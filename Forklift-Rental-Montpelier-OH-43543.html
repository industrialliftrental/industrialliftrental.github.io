Trucks should be recognized as being built in accord with paragraphs 7 through 143 of UL Standards for Safety 558, Second Edition, September 1961 Internal Combustion Engine-Powered Industrial Trucks” and paragraphs 7 through 130 and 132 through 187 of UL Standards for Safety 583, Fourth Edition, November 1956, Revised September 1960 Power-Operated Industrial Trucks.” Trucks and areas of use should be marked in accordance with NFPA Standard No. 505 — 1968, Section 800.</p>
<p>Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines. Rough terrain forklifts help your crew move materials, supplies, and workers safely. Hand trucks lift the load a few inches off the ground, so they meant to be carrying things for long distances or extended periods.</p>
<p>It is good practice to keep the load back against the truck mast as much as possible. If you're looking specifically for Toyota forklifts, this is where you need to look. Ensure loads are stacked evenly on the forks before moving the pallet jack. ICE forklifts can handle loads of up to 15,500 pounds and are ideal for indoor operation on smooth floors.
