<p>JCB rough terrain forklifts are a reliable, comfortable, versatile and easy-to-use solution for any challenging rehandling environment. Train the Trainer” is a six-hour course in which I review OSHA regulations; how to evaluate an operator's performance during a driving test; and how to properly operate and maintain forklifts in terms of their controls, attachments, maintenance, rules of the road, and so on.

<p>Reach trucks aren't meant for moving loads long distances. If you're unable to find a pre-made lifted truck in your area, or if these vehicles are too expensive for your budget, you may have more luck modifying a truck yourself.

The 2X Series consists of two-wheel-steer models with lift capacities from 6,000 to 12,000 pounds, available in two- and four-wheel drive. This because a forklift's lifting capacity is affected by the dimensions of the load (especially load length), the lifting height, and the attachments used.</p>
<h2>Lift Truck Companies Radford</h2>
<p>Forklifts are essential to just about any job involving pallets, but they also cause the most physical injuries.
