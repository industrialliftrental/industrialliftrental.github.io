<h2>Lift Truck For Rent Metairie</h2>
<p>Manual pallet jacks have existed since at least 1918. Commonly known as forklifts, pallet trucks, rider trucks, forktrucks, or lifttrucks. We supply electric and propane forklifts with the option of a narrow aisle style. The Mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets. It is not uncommon for the lift axle to operate with a much smaller tire, however, the tire is often of a greater ply rating and able to support more weight than the larger truck tires.</p>
<p>These forklifts are best when you use the vehicle for a set time each day. The Class I, Class II, and Class IV have a moderated growth rate over the forecast period as end-users are largely adopting Class III and Class V Forklift Trucks for the various applications. The reason that these trucks are ideally suited for off road driving is that the body of the truck is protected by the fact that it's several feet away from the ground, meaning that it's less likely to come into collision with the ground or other objects on the ground.</p>
<p>Without a disruptive third mast, our wide-channel, dual-mast design gives the H Series forklift unmatched visibility.
