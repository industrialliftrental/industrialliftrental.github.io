This means there is approximately a 35% reduction in the turning circle of the forklift, making the reach forklift far more maneuverable than the standard counterbalance forklift.</p>

Operated by the maintenance free battery, this electric pallet truck could easily deal with heavy stuff by its 3300 lbs load capacity. So, the operator can drive straight in the aisle and turn the mast at a 90-degree angle to access the material.</p>
