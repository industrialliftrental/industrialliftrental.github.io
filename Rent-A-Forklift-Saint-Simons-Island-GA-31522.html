<p>We are offering Premium quality Heavy & Medium Load capacity hydraulic Hand Pallet truck. Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>
<p>Here we are talking about ways to improve your business with the help of a hand pallet truck. Safety for order-pickers who work around high-lift trucks is as important as safety for the drivers. We manufacturer heavy duty and extra heavy duty pallets for 3.5 ton and 5 ton load handling. Gregory Poole is proud to offer the best forklift rentals selection in Virginia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.</p>
<p>Lift & place 3 loads onto truck bed (75mm tolerance) and remove upon completion. Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position. This means the lift truck doesn't have to face the shelves—it can drive straight while still picking up loads to the side.</p>
