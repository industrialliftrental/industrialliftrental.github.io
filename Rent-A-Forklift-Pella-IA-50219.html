<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. Due to its smaller forklift dimensions, the pallet jack is not capable of lifting heavy weight. Two or three forklifts are usually shipped on the same load to minimize the freight charges. If you are driving aggressively in a lifted vehicle, it is a lot easier to spot the infraction and track your lifted truck down. Pallet jacks can cost less than $500 and powered hand trucks less than $3,000.</p>
<p>Manitou MSI 30: The diesel-powered MSI 30 offers an impressive maximum load capacity of 6,000 pounds. The comprehensive range of order picker models and options extends the choice of truck configuration to provide the best solution for each customer's application and to maximize pick face access and warehouse space utilization.

Trucks are pushing such boundaries with lift kits these days that it's almost getting ridiculous to see guys actually climb into them.
