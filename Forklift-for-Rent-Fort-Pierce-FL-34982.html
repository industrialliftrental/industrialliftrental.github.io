<p>Welcome to the home of Doosan Forklifts in the UK. The Forklift Trucks Market in Asia Pacific is likely to witness the highest growth in the coming years. This increases road clearance and makes the vehicle appear to be larger than stock vehicles. Dealerships generally charge extra for forklifts that are returned with damage. Whether you need low level pickers, or turret truck pickers, you'll find the machine that best fits your needs below.</p>
<p>For anyone interested in some serious off-roading, lifted trucks can be a great way to take your experience to the next level and conquer all-new trails.
