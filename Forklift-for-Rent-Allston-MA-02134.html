The 2X Series consists of two-wheel-steer models with lift capacities from 6,000 to 12,000 pounds, available in two- and four-wheel drive. This because a forklift's lifting capacity is affected by the dimensions of the load (especially load length), the lifting height, and the attachments used.</p>
