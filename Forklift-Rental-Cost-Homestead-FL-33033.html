Citation needed Unlike standard counterbalance and reach forklifts, These forklifts are steered via the front swivel articulation of the forklift and are therefore much different to manoeuvre than regular forklifts and additionally have no pantograph feature for retrieving stock in narrow aisles.</p>
<p>These reliable reach trucks offer the operator the high-quality, comfortable and spacious position that makes the work safe and enjoyable. You'll need to raise your truck a lot and put on improved suspension components (shocks, springs, etc.) if you're thinking of really going off-road. Also, it is very important that the driver of the lifted vehicle be aware of other vehicles around him or her when switching lanes, backing out, and entering small city roads.</p>
<p>The forklift is every bit as good as they said it would be. I highly recommend this company. Speak to a rental specialist about forklift rental availability and pricing.
