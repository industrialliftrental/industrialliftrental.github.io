<p>Texas First Rentals will remain open during the COVID-19 outbreak to safely serve customers across our territory. That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>
<p>If you are driving a forklift for the first time, one crucial thing to remember is that forklifts are steered by the rear wheels, unlike most cars. Do not alter or eliminate any forklift parts or add any forklift parts or add any accessories such as additional counterweight or lifting attachments unless approved by the manufacturer in writing. Lifted trucks draw attention from everyone on the road and act as giant billboards at local shows, putting that paintjob high up in the sky for everyone to see.</p>
<p>Piggyback lifts - They are designed to lock on the back of delivery trucks for easy transportation to work sites as well as the smooth offloading of products.

For advanced off-roading rigs, we have you covered with shocks fitted for lifted suspensions as well as lift kits for DIY upgrades.</p>

Designed to work in narrow aisles, the electric reach stacker can tilt both forwards and backwards for safer load handling. A body lift does not increase the clearance by a huge amount, other than by allowing for bigger tires that can help raise the underside.</p>
<p>Furniture picking has a very specific order picker that includes a larger platform for more ease and productivity when moving bulky and odd-sized loads. Lift kits are designed to raise your vehicle up without affecting how it rides at all. For trucks with tilting forks, the forks should be horizontal or at full upward till, whichever is less stable.

Built to lift boats in and out of tall storage racks while coping with the corrosive nature of seawater, marina forklifts are over-sized lifts with long, rubber-coated forks.
