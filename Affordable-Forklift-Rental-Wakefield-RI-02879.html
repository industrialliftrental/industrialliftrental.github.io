Never operate a rough terrain forklift unless you are trained and authorized. When people think of forklifts, they usually imagine the small vehicle with two forks on the front that's used for lifting pallets.

That's why Linde Material Handling uses trucks with a modular design for its picking devices, in order to help to minimize physical strain on the driver and increase the efficiency of the picking process in any working environment.</p>

Every year nearly 100 workers are killed and 20,000 are seriously injured in forklift mishaps. Designed to work specifically indoors in tight access environments like high density warehousing, standup forklifts offer a number of efficiency enhancing features that are not available on the "general use" standard sit-down forklift.</p>

We are specialists in quality forklift equipment, forklift sales, forklift rentals, and on-site repairs of forklifts.</p>

<p>Forklifts generally fall into two categories: industrial and rough terrain. The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load-center dimension and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck. When the lift truck's center of gravity falls within the perimeter of this triangle, a load is safe to carry.</p>
<p>Warning: An overhead guard is intended to offer protection from the impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, etc., representative of the job application, but not to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load. First, forklifts can be classified according to the type of engine. While part of the forklift, the mast, fork carriage, and forks are included in the resistance weight since they are in front of the center of the front axle, which acts as the support point or fulcrum.</p>
<p>Sometimes using a forklift for your pallet moving operation is like taking a bazooka to a knife fight. Many aftermarket lift kits provide CV spacers to move the stock axle outward, effectively lengthening it, but spacers aren't necessarily the best answer for the long haul. A properly loaded lift truck does not exceed the rated capacity of the truck as listed on the trucks data plate.</p>
<p>Due to its sideways operation, side load forklifts can easily drive up alongside racks and load and unload without having to turn. Must have valid forklift operator license and experience with counterbalance & reach. Counterbalance forklift trucks are versatile and can be operated both indoors and outdoors.
