<p>Lift Code 4: Three Wheel Electric Trucks, Sit Down. 3. 3 Acknowledgment OSHA's Office of Training and Education wishes to acknowledge the following for contributing some of the graphics used in this presentation:  Caterpillar Lift Trucks  Mason Contractors Association of America  Industrial Truck Association  State of Utah Labor Commission - Occupational Safety & Health Division  Steamship Trade Association of Baltimore  Taylor Machine Works, Inc.</p>
<p>Reach trucks aren't meant for moving loads long distances. If you're unable to find a pre-made lifted truck in your area, or if these vehicles are too expensive for your budget, you may have more luck modifying a truck yourself. The Forklift Order Picker Cages have durable wire mesh backs and side panels and are to be used in conjunction with a body harness (for working at heights).</p>
<p>Furthermore, technical innovations in reach trucks are anticipated to drive the growth of the market in the coming years. Pros: Allow Operators to move vertically and horizontally to pick products and a variety of rack heights. Pedestrian operated lift trucks and pallet trucks are most commonly used in warehouses and storage facilities for the easy transportation of pallets.</p>

Straddle trucks have longer forks than stand-up trucks and are used to carry long materials such as pipes, boards, and trees.</p>
<p>Stand-up trucks are the most common and are often used where there's only one load per bay. Cargo type - You need to consider factors like the packaging of your cargo, the type of pallets used, and whether or not the load has a unique shape.
