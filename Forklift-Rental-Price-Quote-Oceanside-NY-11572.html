Riding or giving rides on forklift or load. Available in two main configurations, internal combustion (IC) and electric, standard forklifts represent the greatest potential for weight capacity - with the deck stacked heavily in favor of IC lifts.</p>
<p>EE. Electrically powered units that have all the safeguards of the E and ES units, plus the electric motor and all other electrical equipment are completely enclosed.
