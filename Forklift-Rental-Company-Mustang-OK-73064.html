<p>These forklifts are known for what their name indicates, their ability to lift loads at a high altitude. Because of these possibilities, operators should be careful to keep the center of gravity firmly within the stability triangle. Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.</p>
<p>Reach forklifts can operate in aisles as narrow as 2.4 meters, as opposed to the counterbalance's minimum requirement of 3.7 meters. With our used forklifts, we can offer up to 36 months on a $1 buyout lease option. Yale has been manufacturing materials handling equipment for over 140 years.

<p>Ground clearance same as cushion tire forklift. Yes, it's going to be harder to get in and out of your truck, but a twisted ankle or scraped knee is a small price to pay compared to a truck body rocketing off of its suspension due to some shoddy craftsmanship. When you are finished with the rental it is a good idea to properly clean the forklift. The most obvious benefit is the increased ground clearance when driving over rugged terrain, which reduces the risk of damage to your undercarriage.</p>
<h2>Hyster Lift Trucks Mustang</h2>
<p>The BT Lifter hand pallet trucks from Toyota have been setting the standard in strength and performance for over 60 years. Between a 45° forward tilt and a 15° rear tilt, the H Series forklift offers the most mast tilt in the industry, allowing operators to keep loads level on any terrain or slope. They are outfitted with an open operator window in order to lift operators up to warehouse racks and carry individual units of inventory.</p>

Available in two main configurations, internal combustion (IC) and electric, standard forklifts represent the greatest potential for weight capacity - with the deck stacked heavily in favor of IC lifts.</p>

<p>Rentals are a repeat business - your customers only rent your equipment for a period of time, so if they need it again in the future they have to rent again.

Learn more about the benefits of a long-term equipment rental and whether it's a good choice for your company.</p>
<p>With a broad range of capabilities, these forklifts can adapt to a variety of warehouse environments and are designed to help you run a faster, smoother operation. If working spaces are tight and pedestrians or other trucks may cross your path, the braking system of a pallet truck must function perfectly. Forklifts were first invented during early part of the 20th century and now had become a vital part of the modern-day industrial world.</p>
<p>This will help determine the capacity of the forklift you need to rent. In the meantime, the global forklift industry is in the midst of robust growth, reaching all-time highs in 2016 as orders topped 1,182,000, up 7% from 2015, which set the previous record. Our BT Lifter Silent hand pallet truck has been designed to not exceed 60 decibels when moving loads.</p>
<p>Cubing forks work best for moving and placing cube-shaped loads of bricks or solid blocks. The Apex features a 6 inch off road suspension, custom wheels, and all-terrain tires.
