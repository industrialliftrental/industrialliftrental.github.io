Your 4×4 truck can be your ticket to off-road adventures, your daily driver around town, your hauling and towing machine, or your work truck. If everything looks sound, place the pallet jack in a designed storage area, with the handle locked in a raised position.</p>

They also build gas, diesel, and electric engines for their forklifts. They have dual forks at the front of the truck and a weight in the back to offset the weight of the load in the front.
