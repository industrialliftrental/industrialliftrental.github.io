<p>The global forklift market has had a resurgence in the last two years but constant R&D, particularly in electric industrial vehicles and smart equipment, is essential, says Bob Wang, marketing director for Chinese manufacturer Hangcha.

<p>Our company has a variety of finance options available on our forklifts for sale to simplify the process for you and get you back to work quickly. The rough-terrain or straight-mast forklift has become more of a niche machine, rather than an ‘everybody-needs-one' machine,” says Charlie Detrich, U.S. sales & dealer development manager for Liftking. Heubel Shaw's large rental fleet includes Reach trucks, Stand up forklifts, sitdown 4-wheel and 3-wheel forklifts, order pickers and pallet jacks.</p>
<p>The articulated forklift is suited to narrow aisles and the loading or offloading of trucks. Sit-down forklifts are also more accessible to a wider pool of forklift operators for that reason. Test N5 - both reach and straddle trucks (except with tilting mast) - stability is usually obvious, in which case test may be waived. The suspension lift kit helps drivers conquer uneven and off-road terrain.</p>

The Raymond High-capacity Reach-Fork truck integrates telematics capabilities to increase efficiency.</p>

When standard pallet sizes launched in 1930, forklifts became even more useful. Simple does not mean you should try to install this kind of lift kit yourself, however, unless you have a lot of experience with working on truck frames and bodies and the right equipment to do it safely.</p>

If you have ever ridden in, or driven a lowered truck, you are well aware of that lifted Super Duty coming up from behind with the headlights shining clear above your cab and lighting up the night sky ahead of you, as if you had a roof-mounted lightbar attached to your road grater.</p>
<p>Buy used forklifts from the top manufacturers including Toyota, Cat, Komatsu, and more. Jacks feature 4mm-thick steel construction, with reinforced fork bracing and sealed ball bearings on wheels. The forks on a reach truck are attached to a pantograph mechanism that extends them forward to place in or retrieve pallets from warehouse racking. The forklift's overhead guard will quickly pin or crush a jumping operator.</p>
<p>Most forklifts have a three-point suspension system. For all their benefits to the modern workplace, forklifts bring with them numerous hazards. Before you even pick up a pallet, the jack has a base weight that should be factored into any maximum weight restrictions for certain surfaces, such as lift gates or container floors. From moving products on and off trucks, to storing them in a warehouse, it takes a lot of energy.</p>
<p>Electric forklifts are battery-powered and will generally last through one standard shift before needing to be recharged. We offer free equipment rental assessment surveys to determine what specifications match your project requirements. Different mast types allow buyers to tailor machines more closely to applications frequently encountered. That can include adding some special tires, wheels, and lights to their truck.</p>
