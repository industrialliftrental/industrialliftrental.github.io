<p>While lift kits can certainly increase utility, function and style for many truck owners, there are a few safety issues to consider first. Industrial lift truck is defined in regulation as: a self-propelled vehicle used to carry, lift, stack, tier, push or pull material. Like most other lifts, a counterbalance forklift has a pair of forks in front of the vehicle.</p>
<p>In addition to simply driving a fork lift, working as a fork lift operator requires the ability to properly lift, balance, and stack heavy loads that are ordinarily arranged on a wood pallet or a pallet made from other materials. High-level order pickers enable an operator to pick cases or items from 20 feet to 35 feet. Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
<p>Jacks can also lessen fatigue of employees, as they won't be taking on the physical toll of moving heavy material.
