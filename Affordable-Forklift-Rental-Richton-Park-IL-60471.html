If you are looking for a Forklift dealer to handle any or all of your Material Handling needs with the highest of quality, AJ Jersey is the answer. Employers must have a training program that incorporates general principles of safe operation, the types of vehicle(s) used, any hazards created by using forklifts and powered industrial trucks, and OSHA's general safety requirements.</p>
<p>While a side loader can measure less than five feet wide to fit into narrow spaces, a counterbalance forklift may need up to 13 feet to easily turn and maneuver through aisles. Your 4×4 truck can be your ticket to off-road adventures, your daily driver around town, your hauling and towing machine, or your work truck. If everything looks sound, place the pallet jack in a designed storage area, with the handle locked in a raised position.</p>
<p>Place empty truck on an initially level test platform in a position that the centerline of a truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the test platform and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position.

<p>Kalmar's years of experience in extreme applications all over the world have provided the knowledge needed to perfect the most heavy duty lifting equipment available on the market. For example a pallet jack is not the same as a three-wheel counterbalance lift truck yet they are both classed as a forklift. This means that Linde reach trucks can maneuver safely and quickly, even in confined spaces and handling conditions in warehouses.</p>
<p>A lift kit gives your truck a lot of added benefits that other trucks don't have. It's for this reason that electricity-powered forklifts are the perfect option for indoor work as they don't' release any fuel emissions, and they make less noise.
