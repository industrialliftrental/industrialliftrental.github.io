<p>BVA offers a wide range of industrial products to suit any industry including construction, mining, oil, forestry, foundation repair, MRO, OEMs and more. To be eligible for Modern's annual Top 20 lift truck suppliers ranking, companies must manufacture and sell lift trucks in at least one of the Industrial Truck Association's seven truck classes: electric motor rider; electric motor hand trucks; internal combustion engine; pneumatic tire; electric and internal combustion engine tow tractors; and rough terrain lift trucks.</p>
<p>Contact us if you have more forklift accident statistics to contribute to this page. The traditional model of the forklift stability triangle is useful, but it leaves out one important thing: three-dimensional space. Stand-Up Rider = A lift truck designed to be controlled by an operator standing. But if the forklift is put in motion, or sits on a sloping surface, its center of gravity shifts.</p>
<p>Class V forklifts are being majorly used in warehouses and distribution centers. While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour. The reach forklift is a warehouse truck used mainly for indoor work. We offer a sprawling inventory of used forklifts for sale.</p>

These calculations take into account variations in design including tire, mast, and other deflections, and provide a means for predicting with reasonable accuracy the stability of fork trucks.</p>
<p>These manual pallet jacks are ideal for special applications. 55. 55 Rule: Employees will not place any part of their bodies outside the running lines of an industrial truck or between mast uprights or other parts of the truck where shear or crushing hazards exist.

The two main types of forklift engine types are electric forklifts, powered by a battery, and internal combustion (IC) forklifts, which have a traditional engine that runs on liquid propane, gas or diesel.</p>
<p>Renting your forklift can also mean significantly lower up-front costs and the ability to plan on consistent monthly expenditures.
