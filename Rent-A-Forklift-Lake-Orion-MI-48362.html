<p>Industrial counterbalance forklifts are the most common trucks used in indoor warehouses and stores. Angled lower backrest provides the operator with a clear view of the fork tips, which makes it easier for the operator to insert the forks into a pallet. Rough terrain forklifts typically have rugged tyres and feature heavy-duty construction. Trucks may be of the reaching or non-reaching type, equipped with tilting mast, or forks that tilt alone without tilting mast, or without any form of mast or fork tilt.</p>
<p>They provide a reliable, economical material handling solution. This reflects an order intake of 109,200 forklifts (+12.5%) and 106,300 units produced (+16.6%). Electric forklifts run on a battery and or more expensive than their IC counterparts upfront, but are much less expensive long-term (no fuel costs). Owing to the increase in the size of the wheels, you also need sizeable brakes to bring the lifted truck to a stop safely.</p>
<p>They generally have a more limited range of types of rental equipment. All-round ergonomic working conditions are a fundamental part of the truck designs, including vibration-cushioned platforms, intuitively laid out control panels, low entry height and sufficient space for terminals and mounting brackets.
