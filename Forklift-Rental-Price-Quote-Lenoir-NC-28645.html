<p>Forklift is a small industrial vehicle, having a power operated forked platform attached at the front that can be raised and lowered for insertion under a cargo to lift or move it. Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities. If your need entails lifting loads in outdoor sites, then a rough terrain forklift may be for you. Often, this is not as easy to accomplish with the transmission or transfer case side of the driveshaft, and your U-joint-style driveshaft is best tossed for a custom unit, using a double cardan or CV joint that can run smoothly at higher angles. If you're looking for all terrain forklift for sale or forklift hire call our team on (09) 887 2523 today or enquire online for a free quote.</p>

Stand-up forklift trucks feature ComfortStance Suspension for a smoother ride.</p>
