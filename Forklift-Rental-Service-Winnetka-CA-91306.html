Usually, these lift trucks are free roaming, but can be set up for wire or rail guidance. A suspension lift kit will truly give you that monster truck feeling, as they can be raised as high as practically possible.</p>

Many aftermarket lift kits provide CV spacers to move the stock axle outward, effectively lengthening it, but spacers aren't necessarily the best answer for the long haul. A properly loaded lift truck does not exceed the rated capacity of the truck as listed on the trucks data plate.</p>
