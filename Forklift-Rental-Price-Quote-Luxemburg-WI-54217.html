<p>Industrial counterbalance forklifts are the most common trucks used in indoor warehouses and stores. Angled lower backrest provides the operator with a clear view of the fork tips, which makes it easier for the operator to insert the forks into a pallet. Rough terrain forklifts typically have rugged tyres and feature heavy-duty construction. Trucks may be of the reaching or non-reaching type, equipped with tilting mast, or forks that tilt alone without tilting mast, or without any form of mast or fork tilt.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Crown introduced a new 2-stage TL mast , commonly referred to as a Truckers Mast,” for its Crown FC 5200 Series counterbalance forklifts and the pneumatic and cushion tire models of the Crown C-5 Series industrial forklifts. Some small work zones and warehouses require a compact-sized forklift for safe maneuvering and material handling, while more demanding loads require a heavy-duty model designed for maximum lifting power or extra height.</p>
<p>Low-Lift and Nonelevating — Platform and Pallet Trucks — The maximum weight, expressed in pounds, with load center near the center of the load engaging means. Lift Cylinder: Controls the amount by which the mast structure, forks and carriage may be raised or lowered in the vertical. Raymond® Type E and EE trucks are designed and manufactured to operate in classified locations as defined in NFPA 505.</p>
