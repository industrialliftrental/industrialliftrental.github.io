<h2>Used Electric Pallet Jack Catlettsburg</h2>
<p>The order picker operator stands on a platform and moves up with the mast, unlike most lift trucks. By decreasing the air pressure, the driver can decrease the weight-carrying capacity of the axle or eliminate it completely by raising it up and off of the road. This is very important to the safety of the forklift operator. All parts are stainless including hydraulic pump, fork frame, handle, push rod, bearing, pin and bolt, etc.</p>

Operated by the maintenance free battery, this electric pallet truck could easily deal with heavy stuff by its 3300 lbs load capacity. So, the operator can drive straight in the aisle and turn the mast at a 90-degree angle to access the material.</p>
