<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Check to make sure that the pallet jack is not on the cross wood of the skid, front wheels must be on the floor. In a forklift the operator sits on a seat with a seatbelt, a steering wheel and hand controls to move the lifting mechanisms. We offer certification on the Counterbalance Forklift from the following awarding bodies: RTITB, NPORS, CPCS, LANTRA. Our OSHA experts and training specialists are standing by to help you with all your counterbalance forklift training needs.</p>
<p>While a side loader can measure less than five feet wide to fit into narrow spaces, a counterbalance forklift may need up to 13 feet to easily turn and maneuver through aisles. Your 4×4 truck can be your ticket to off-road adventures, your daily driver around town, your hauling and towing machine, or your work truck. If everything looks sound, place the pallet jack in a designed storage area, with the handle locked in a raised position.</p>
<p>Their high capacity of up to three tons and easy manoeuvrability in tight spaces make hand pallet trucks the perfect warehouse aid. Although forklifts are fairly easy machines to operate, it is recommended that all drivers receive proper forklift training and certification. Whether you need an electric lift rental, internal combustion machine, multi-direction side loader, narrow aisle and high-density lift, rough terrain or truck and trailer mounted forklift, you can find it at our convenient Sacramento store.</p>
