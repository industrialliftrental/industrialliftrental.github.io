<p>We provide high quality counterbalance forklift, reach forklift truck, pallet truck, stacker dedicated to your business. It's not just one thing, it's the combination of the increased height, massive off-road tires, fender flares, off-road lights, and Sports Bar. With individually configured new forklift trucks from Jungheinrich, you can breathe new life into your goods and material flow - with the highest levels of efficiency, power, safety and sustainability that can be found in a forklift.</p>
<p>These forklifts are known for what their name indicates, their ability to lift loads at a high altitude. Because of these possibilities, operators should be careful to keep the center of gravity firmly within the stability triangle. Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.</p>
<p>Service intervals of 1,000 operating hours mean that trucks operate reliably. Whether you're using the truck to commute to work every day or planning to carve your own path offroad, choosing the right lift kit is a crucial decision. Not all kits are created equal, and a rough-riding rig can add to fatigue on long trips, make controlling the vehicle exhausting, and put wear on the truck itself.</p>

JCB : Known for their proprietary Dieselmax engine, JCB equipment is powered by a 74 hp low-rev engine shown to enhance efficiency in rough terrain situations while providing maximum fuel efficiency.
