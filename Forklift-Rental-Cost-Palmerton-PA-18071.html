<p>Lift Code 4: Three Wheel Electric Trucks, Sit Down. If your employees will be expected to operate several different types of powered industrial trucks, then training is required on the unique handling characteristics of the vehicles. Having larger tires will also make it so that rough areas in the trail will have less effect on your off-road ride.

Some small work zones and warehouses require a compact-sized forklift for safe maneuvering and material handling, while more demanding loads require a heavy-duty model designed for maximum lifting power or extra height.</p>
