<p>Forklifts have different shapes and sizes, also meet different and varied purposes. The hand pallet or lift truck has wheels located under the fork and uses a hydraulic jack for lifting and moving the pallets. These attachments, and the ability to extend the lifting capabilities with front outriggers, enable the tele-handler to complete work at heights that normal forklifts can't reach.</p>
