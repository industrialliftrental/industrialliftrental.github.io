<p>If it is not meant for roller chain pulleys then forklifts would require much taller cylinders to lift up the load to an equivalent height. All hydraulic functions can be controlled using proportional finger tips for precise and safe load handling.

<p>Forklifts have different shapes and sizes, also meet different and varied purposes. The hand pallet or lift truck has wheels located under the fork and uses a hydraulic jack for lifting and moving the pallets. These attachments, and the ability to extend the lifting capabilities with front outriggers, enable the tele-handler to complete work at heights that normal forklifts can't reach.</p>
