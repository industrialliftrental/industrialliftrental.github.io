<p>Diamond now has separate websites for Equipment and Event Rentals. Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>Stay up to date by perusing manuals, guides, and literature put out by the manufacturers of the forklifts as well as the industry leaders. Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension. Stand-up forklift trucks feature ComfortStance Suspension for a smoother ride.</p>
<p>The fork lift truck used for the training at Coleg Menai is GAS OPERATED. The following are examples of Class II powered industrial trucks. Obviously the biggest difference between the two forklifts is the position of the operator. Out of 83 reviews, the average customer rating for Lifted Suspension Parts: 4.8 out of 5. It becomes a little more robust and capable of handling larger loads.</p>
