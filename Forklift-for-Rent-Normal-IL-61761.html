Sitting forklift controls mirror automobile controls with a steering wheel and hydraulic levers for the forklift mast. It's worth noting that cushion tire forklifts are often less expensive and more readily available, both new and used, than pneumatic-tired forklifts.</p>

The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck. If other tests or tests for trucks over 10,000 lb rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parries.</p>
