<p>These powered industrial trucks are known as counterbalance forklifts. Loop handle is spring loaded to return to upright position and eliminate bending to retrieve. One of the most important tests on a forklift is the American Society of Mechanical Engineers stability test. Reach trucks are often designed to work within narrow aisles and confined storage spaces, and are able to be tightly maneuvered around corners and shelves.</p>
