What you need to do: Take a practical test where the forklift is driven around a suitable course and the operator will be required to move and stack various loads, the test will also include one to one verbal questioning.</p>

Often, a driver will raise the axle to enable the vehicle to turn easier and not have to drag the lift axle sideways through a turn.</p>
<p>The forklift is every bit as good as they said it would be. I highly recommend this company. Speak to a rental specialist about forklift rental availability and pricing.
