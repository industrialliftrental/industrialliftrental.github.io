We are looking for Order Picker Forklift operator with 6 months to 1 year experience to work in Mississauga. The result is a smarter, more scalable fleet of reach trucks.

The Mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets weighing 3,000 - 6,000lbs.
