Considerations include forklift type, capacity, carriage type, and number of hydraulic functions (that power the attachment features). Using the procedure outlined for this test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which horizontal travel with unrestricted turning is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified in Graph D. Curve 1.</p>
<p>As can be imagined, there are many different industries and workplace environments in which pallet trucks can be used. They offer complete repair and maintenance services across most equipment makes and models.
