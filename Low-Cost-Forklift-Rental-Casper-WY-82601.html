<p>While moving palletized loads is fastest and easiest, these machines can load and unload a variety of objects. Our Rental Purchase Option (RPO) provides customers with an opportunity to acquire equipment by building equity over the rental period. Growing industrialization is anticipated to drive the demand for pallet trucks, especially from non-traditional industries in growing economies in Asia Pacific.</p>
<p>When lifting a load, a reach truck moves the load back within the wheelbase, meaning less of the load is protruding from the reach truck. In the event of a crash with a lifted truck, the injuries can be extensive. We only sell forklifts that we are confident to be a great value for the condition it is in. Through our connections and many resources, we are always adding units to our inventory, giving you a wide selection of makes and models to suit the needs of your operation.</p>

<p>I notice two things right off the bat; one, the truck looks just about at home up there on that lift kit as it does on its stock ride height; and two, it hasn't seemed to have aged. Suspension lifts, particularly longarm kits, can require extensive modification to the vehicle and should only be installed by a skilled professional. Common uses for these types of forklifts run the gamut, including agriculture, oil refineries, construction, manufacturing, paper mills, and pipe yards.</p>

Collision hazards are a big concern for counterbalance forklifts. OSHA estimates that 110,000 forklift accidents take place every year at U.S. jobsites.

If at any time a powered industrial truck is found to be in need of repair, defective, or in any way unsafe, the matter shall be reported immediately to the designated authority, and the truck shall be taken out of service until it has been restored to safe operating condition.</p>
<p>If you love to go off-road, you might want to modify your truck's steering system with off-road lugs to keep your steering components more secure, but this can lead to problems when you're driving on paved roads, making it more difficult to steer and handle your truck in all kinds of situations. Make sure that the lifted truck has modified brakes with larger than normal rotors and calipers that are capable of stopping the truck in a reasonable distance.</p>

<p>Sometimes an attachment has more features than your forklift has hydraulic functions and one or more need to be added. You would have to determine whether or not you are operating on a ramp, how heavy the load is, the kind of condition the pallet truck is in, and the distance you have to cover. You will also be taught the general safety rules, proper inspection criteria and how to safely fuel your forklift.</p>
