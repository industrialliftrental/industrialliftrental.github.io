<h2>Lift Truck Rental Salem</h2>
<p>The order picker operator stands on a platform and moves up with the mast, unlike most lift trucks.

Newer vehicles sporting the latest in electronics often have a Vehicle Speed Sensor (VSS) which uses electronic sensors to tell the truck's computer how fast the truck is moving.</p>
<p>As with any lift, raising a load must be performed where the machine can remain stable. The other concept to understand is the forklift's center of gravity. The other, more complex style of truck lift is a suspension lift kit.” The suspension lift requires more work to accommodate and usually costs a bit more.
