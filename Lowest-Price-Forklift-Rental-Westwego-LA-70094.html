<h2>Electric Pallet Truck Westwego</h2>
<p>Warehouse order picker forklift is ideal for narrow aisles. These trucks, converted with a standard suspension lift, large tires, and quality safety technology, are built to handle off-road driving, road trips, or work at construction sites. Standup trucks lift and slide pallets in a simple movement and double deep trucks have extra long forks which are able to be used in two pallet deep shelving systems.</p>
<p>The forklift is designed with a load limit for the forks which is decreased with fork elevation and undercutting of the load (i.e., when a load does not butt against the fork "L"). That's why many pallet trucks are barely wider than a pallet.
