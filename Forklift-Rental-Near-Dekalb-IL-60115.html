<p>As forklift operators need to sit in their machine for hours together, a high-quality adjustable seat is essential.

<p>Do not tow or push railway cars or trucks with a forklift. 35 inches or bigger is the common size range for determining whether or not a truck is truly a lifted truck. Add on a 6-inch lift kit and 35-inch tires on 20-inch wheels, and it's simply massive. An alternative to class 3s, tuggers can pull large loads without requiring the equipment to lift it off the ground to do it.
