An all-steel low lift truck design with the same premise became the first 20th-century innovation that resembled the modern forklift. They feature specially-designed lifting carriages and come in two configurations: with mast and with reach.</p>
<p>Popular brands of standup forklifts include Yale, Crown, Baker, Hyster, and Raymond, which range in price from as little as $5,000 used to as much as $35,000 for a fully equipped new machine. We proudly offer Unicarrier, Hyundai, Baoli, Flexi, JLG, and Linde forklifts to meet your preference. Simply click on the forklift make and model you are interested in for pricing.</p>
<p>There are two different ways that lift kits are designed, which dictates how they are installed and each one lifts the truck in a different way.
