In a world full of pretty show ponies, it's encouraging to see trucks built to wreck shop, and there's nothing like the sound of a carbureted big block with straight headers. Lifted trucks from respected companies like Rocky Ridge are the best option since they have experience and numerous positive reviews.</p>
