However, to maximize the benefits you can gain from a short-term forklift rental, you need to understand lift truck rental agreements and how they align to the needs of your specific business. The lifted suspension helps your truck better handle the rough nature of going off-road, plus the higher ground clearance means you won't bottom out as often.</p>
