<p>216.1 (1) No person shall alter an industrial lift truck in such a way as to render ineffective a safety device installed on the truck, except where the alteration has been certified in writing by the manufacturer of the device or an engineer as affording protection equal to or greater than the protection afforded by the original device.

<p>Forklifts have different shapes and sizes, also meet different and varied purposes. The hand pallet or lift truck has wheels located under the fork and uses a hydraulic jack for lifting and moving the pallets. These attachments, and the ability to extend the lifting capabilities with front outriggers, enable the tele-handler to complete work at heights that normal forklifts can't reach.</p>
<p>These powered industrial trucks includes reach and deep (or double) reach lift trucks as well as order selector trucks (also known as order pickers or cherry pickers). If the truck is originally equipped with front end attachments, the truck nameplate shall also be marked to identify the attachments and show the approximate weight of the truck and attachment combination and capacity of the truck and attachment combination at maximum elevation of the load engaging means with load laterally centered.</p>
