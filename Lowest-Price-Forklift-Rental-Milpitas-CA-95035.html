<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? For tests requiring an elevated load, it may be more convenient to simulate a load by hanging the test load from a framework supported by the forks in the manner described in item 3. This point of suspension, of course, must be on centerline of truck and at a height above forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>
<p>The forks should be elevated until the point of intersection of the two carrying surfaces of the forks is elevated 12 inches from the rest platform to the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks. Knowing what types of lifts are installed in vehicles and identifying which one will serve you best will make your buying experience a pleasant one.</p>
<p>That's exactly what a lifted truck is all about. Sleep soundly knowing that your business is covered when you buy a new forklift, used forklift or rent a forklift from us. FORKS: Horizontal tine-line projections, normally suspended from the carriage, for engaging and supporting loads. Hiring a forklift means that you won't have to rent or buy a permanent forklift and can merely acquire one for the busy period in order to pick up the slack.</p>
