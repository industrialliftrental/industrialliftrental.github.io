<p>Electric forklift not holding charge? Lifting capacity and weight will also vary whether it's manual or electric. Operate trucks equipped with attachments as partially loaded trucks when not handling a load.

The mast shall be at full rearward tilt and the load the load then elevated until the point of intersection of the two load carrying surfaces of the forks is 12 inches from the floor. While most standard forklifts can reach between 10 and 15 feet, a telehandler can lift to heights of 55 feet.</p>
