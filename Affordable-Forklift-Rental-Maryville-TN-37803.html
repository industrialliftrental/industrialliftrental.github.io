<p>Rentals are a repeat business - your customers only rent your equipment for a period of time, so if they need it again in the future they have to rent again. A forklift that cannot tolerate the amount of weight to the proper height is not only a waste of time and money, but very dangerous. Learn more about the benefits of a long-term equipment rental and whether it's a good choice for your company.</p>
<p>Backed with a team of professional and experts of the industry, we are involved in offering Roll Pallet Truck. On a manual pallet truck, lifting and moving is done manually, while on a semi-electric pallet truck the lifting is done electrically.

<p>This will help determine the capacity of the forklift you need to rent. In the meantime, the global forklift industry is in the midst of robust growth, reaching all-time highs in 2016 as orders topped 1,182,000, up 7% from 2015, which set the previous record.
