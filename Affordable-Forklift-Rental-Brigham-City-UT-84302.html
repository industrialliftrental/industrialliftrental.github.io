A walk-behind narrow aisle lift truck with a 3,000 to 4,000 pound capacity costs approximately $15,000 to $18,000. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, with the superior quality in ride characteristics of a system like the Range Rover air suspension and Lincoln Navigator airride, the one downfall is durability. Practical: Pre-Operational checks of forklift and working area, pre-operational checks of order picker and working area, negotiating hazards, shifting loads, placing loads in and out of racking, loading & unloading trucks and shut down procedures.</p>

<p>Long Term Forklift Rental includes all fair wear and tear items and repairs over the life of the agreement, which avoids unscheduled out of pocket expenses. Having an order picker licence and forklift licence combined is a huge advantage when looking for work in the warehouse industry. Now that is an awesome start to a lifted truck, having an underbody that is rust free and ready to go. No rusty fuel lines, brake lines, gas tanks, axles or rotors all this matters.</p>
