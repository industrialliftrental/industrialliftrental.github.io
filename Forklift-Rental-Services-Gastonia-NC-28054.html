<p>Forklifts generally fall into two categories: industrial and rough terrain. The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load-center dimension and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck. When the lift truck's center of gravity falls within the perimeter of this triangle, a load is safe to carry.</p>
<p>The higher, stronger suspension means these trucks can handle trails that are off the beaten path better than their non-lifted relatives. If the Hydraulic hand Pallet truck is not overloaded beyond the rated capacity and not pushed around on very rough surfaces then it gives good service for a very long extended period of more than 5 years. Better ground clearance than cushion tire forklift, softer ride, but larger chassis.</p>
<p>These reliable reach trucks offer the operator the high-quality, comfortable and spacious position that makes the work safe and enjoyable. You'll need to raise your truck a lot and put on improved suspension components (shocks, springs, etc.) if you're thinking of really going off-road. Also, it is very important that the driver of the lifted vehicle be aware of other vehicles around him or her when switching lanes, backing out, and entering small city roads.</p>
<p>Some smaller industrial forklifts are powered by an electric motor running off an internal battery. Unlike most car repairs or upgrades, lifting a truck requires a little more effort than getting a few gearhead friends together on a Sunday afternoon to gather around a toolbox and a twelve-pack.
