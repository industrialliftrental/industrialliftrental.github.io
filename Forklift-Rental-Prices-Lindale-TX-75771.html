<p>All-terrain and rough terrain forklifts are the preferred lift truck type for construction sites, ranches, farms and other outdoor environments. 2. Three-Wheel Counterbalance - These forklifts feature three wheels as opposed to four in their counterbalance forerunners. Body lift kits are primarily used to lift up a truck or SUV either two or three inches higher. The forklift network carries high-quality equipment in all 50 states and 3 countries.</p>

LOAD CENTER: The horizontal longitudinal distance from the intersection of the horizontal load-carrying surfaces and vertical load-engaging faces of the forks (or equivalent load positioning structure) to the center of gravity of the load.</p>
<p>They are also sometimes referred to as pallet trucks, pallet pumps, and pump trucks. The load limit of the lift truck decreases as the load centre is raised. Weight capacity is a necessary requirement when renting a forklift. It is very important to pick the pallet trucks that suits your business needs the most. This includes a Multimatic DSSV damping system on the off-road suspension, which allows for a smooth and surprisingly comfortable ride on even the roughest trails.</p>

<p>Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels. Almost identical to the 6,000 lb. 4-wheel, the 6,500 lb. truck has a slightly heavier counterweight. The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it. The name comes from the counterweight in the rear of the vehicle.</p>
<p>Now you've seen how a forklift's center of gravity can shift. Conveniently mounted on the cowl, the hydraulic control levers allow the operator to gain access from the right or left side of the truck. The China Pallet Trucks market holds a major value share in the global market and is likely maintain its dominance in the global Pallet Trucks market over the forecast period.</p>
