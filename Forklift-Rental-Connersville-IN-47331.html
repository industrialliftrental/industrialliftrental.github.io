<p>This course is designed to provide experienced operators with relevant knowledge and understanding of practical use of the Industrial Counterbalance Forklift. In the Guru, when referring to overall width for class 2 & 3 trucks, overall width refers to the width of the power unit, not the outriggers. Specifically, adding such a large lift kit or monstrous wheels and tires can make daily driving around the city a real chore. No matter what size or capacity you need, you can find a rough terrain forklift for the job.</p>
<p>Order picker forklifts are specially designed devices that are used to optimize the speed and ease of picking stock from both sides of a warehouse aisle. We have taken every care to ensure that your rental lift truck has the toughness and durability to withstand the most demanding material handling operations. Pallet jacks can bear a lot of weight, but they also have limits that cannot be safely exceeded.</p>
<p>Powered by lead-acid batteries or, increasingly, lithium-ion batteries , include: cushion tire forklifts, scissor lifts, order pickers, stackers, reach trucks and pallet jacks. Trucks are pushing such boundaries with lift kits these days that it's almost getting ridiculous to see guys actually climb into them. Safety features of this forklift truck include a high-visibility overhead guard, an emergency power disconnect switch, electric horn, and an anti-static ground strap.</p>

See below for more information on our counterbalance forklifts ranges.</p>
<p>The Raymond 5300 Orderpicker truck is the ultimate in order picking value. The 2X Series consists of two-wheel-steer models with lift capacities from 6,000 to 12,000 pounds, available in two- and four-wheel drive. This because a forklift's lifting capacity is affected by the dimensions of the load (especially load length), the lifting height, and the attachments used.</p>
