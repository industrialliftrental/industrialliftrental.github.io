<p>Service intervals of 1,000 operating hours mean that trucks operate reliably. Whether you're using the truck to commute to work every day or planning to carve your own path offroad, choosing the right lift kit is a crucial decision.

<p>Telescopic forks - hydraulic attachments that allow the operator to operate in warehouse design for "double-deep stacking", which means that two pallet shelves are placed behind each other without any aisle between them. Attachments can be used with forklifts to make the work easier and add additional functions. SFS's Hand Pallet truck can also be used for carrying small non palletised loads with suitable improvisation to hold the load on the forks.</p>

Additionally, the larger tires of a lifted truck are designed to flex around obstacles like large rocks, which translates to more tire-to-ground contact for greater traction.
