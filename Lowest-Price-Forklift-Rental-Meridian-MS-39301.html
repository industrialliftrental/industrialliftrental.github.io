<p>Lets face it, rust matters and when we start to build a truck to make it custom and lifted for our customer, we start with a rust free truck. If you're renting with inside or warehouse work in mind, a Narrow Aisle Truck is the way to go for spaces under ten feet. Lift kits can put added pressure on the driveshaft angles , causing intense vibrations at peak speeds.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, with the superior quality in ride characteristics of a system like the Range Rover air suspension and Lincoln Navigator airride, the one downfall is durability.

A body lift does not increase the clearance by a huge amount, other than by allowing for bigger tires that can help raise the underside.</p>
