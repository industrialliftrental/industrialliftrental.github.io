<p>Efficient storage is an operational focus for many warehouse and industrial space owners and forklift trucks allow a company to make the most of their vertical storage capacity. Select Equipment has a large fleet of forklifts for rent in the following counties: Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange, San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles, San Diego, Kern, Tulare, Fresno, Madera, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura, Alameda, Stanislaus, Sacramento, Santa Cruz, Monterey and all of Southern California.</p>
<p>Reality: the higher a heavy load is lifted, the less safe a forklift becomes. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. By applying air pressure to the lift axle, the driver is able to add one more axle into the equation and relieve some of the weight being supported by the other axles.</p>
