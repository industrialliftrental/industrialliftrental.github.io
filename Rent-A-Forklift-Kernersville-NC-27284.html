Because of these possibilities, operators should be careful to keep the center of gravity firmly within the stability triangle. Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.</p>
<p>A truck lifted with a 2.5-inch coil spacer. With the test load elevated to maximum height, and for trucks with tilting up 4 rights without change in the original overhang dimensions, the test platform shall be tipped to the specified slope.
