<p>Gradability = The maximum percent of a slope a lift truck can negotiate with a capacity load.

For example, a hydraulic skate is not the same as a counterbalanced tricycle, although both are classified as forklifts. In industry sectors where robust and versatile equipment is required, two materials handling options - telehandlers and rough-terrain forklifts - stand out.</p>
<p>This series includes lift trucks that can lift loads from 1 t to 8 t. The models are split into three categories, starting with the 1-3,5-t models. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. While you'll typically use a rough terrain forklift outdoors, some models can operate indoors.

Because there is no load, the center of gravity is nearly in the center of the forklift's counterbalance. When you lift a truck or SUV, the lifting process typically involves adding new aftermarket performance parts such as brakes, shocks , bigger wheels , or tires to your truck.</p>
