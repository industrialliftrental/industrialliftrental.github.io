<p>Rough terrain forklifts are reliable, versatile and easy-to-use. While size plays an important role, forklifts carry an impressive amount of weight due to their special design. In 2019, counterbalance forklift trucks accounted for more than 60% industry share. If you drive a forklift on an incline, you must keep the load on the uphill side. We are always writing about you can drive what fits you without getting scammed, how financing really works, and service tips that keep your vehicle running at peak performance.</p>

<h2>Used Pallet Truck Camano Island</h2>
<p>The BT Lifter hand pallet trucks from Toyota have been setting the standard in strength and performance for over 60 years. Between a 45° forward tilt and a 15° rear tilt, the H Series forklift offers the most mast tilt in the industry, allowing operators to keep loads level on any terrain or slope. They are outfitted with an open operator window in order to lift operators up to warehouse racks and carry individual units of inventory.</p>
