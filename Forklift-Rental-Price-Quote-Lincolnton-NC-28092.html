<p>Diamond now has separate websites for Equipment and Event Rentals. These electric-powered lift trucks are generally designed for sit-down operation, but standing models are also available. Reach forklifts are narrower than a typical forklift, allowing them to navigate in spaces their beefier brethren would dare not roam. These models have a bigger lift shaft and an increased tyre size on the front end to carry heavier loads.</p>
<p>Stay up to date by perusing manuals, guides, and literature put out by the manufacturers of the forklifts as well as the industry leaders. Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension. Stand-up forklift trucks feature ComfortStance Suspension for a smoother ride.</p>
<p>Class I vehicles include three-wheel electric sit-down trucks; and high- and low-platform sit-down rider type trucks with cushion tires or pneumatic tires. The Teletruk offers typical savings of up to 30% on operating costs compared to a masted forklift truck. Yet large trucks can't be raised and driven safely until their brakes are modified. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity.</p>
