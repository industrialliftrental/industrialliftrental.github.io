<p>Order picking trucks have a working platform that helps the operator to control the lift. Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
