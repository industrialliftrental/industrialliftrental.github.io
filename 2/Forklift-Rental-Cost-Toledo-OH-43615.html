<p>This course is designed to provide experienced operators with relevant knowledge and understanding of practical use of the Industrial Counterbalance Forklift. In the Guru, when referring to overall width for class 2 & 3 trucks, overall width refers to the width of the power unit, not the outriggers. Specifically, adding such a large lift kit or monstrous wheels and tires can make daily driving around the city a real chore. No matter what size or capacity you need, you can find a rough terrain forklift for the job.</p>
<p>Options and accessories available for this type of forklifts include a rail guidance, load-facing operator controls, a retractable tether, and an auto-locking pallet clamp. Every year nearly 100 workers are killed and 20,000 are seriously injured in forklift mishaps. Designed to work specifically indoors in tight access environments like high density warehousing, standup forklifts offer a number of efficiency enhancing features that are not available on the "general use" standard sit-down forklift.</p>
<p>Linear speed control, an option on many competitors' trucks, is standard on all SP models and utilises a variable height sensor to measure platform height and determine the optimum speed level. Therefore, a truck's suspension has to be lifted and its components adjusted so everything fits and works well. Skilled forklift operators annually compete in obstacle and timed challenges at regional forklift rodeos.</p>
