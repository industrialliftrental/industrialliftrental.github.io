Pallet jacks can cost less than $500 and powered hand trucks less than $3,000.</p>

If everything looks sound, place the pallet jack in a designed storage area, with the handle locked in a raised position.</p>
<p>Built for the extreme, the WT Series platform pallet truck features a cast-steel reinforced chassis, up to 12 mm thick covers, die-cast aluminum handle and the toughest side restraints available. That is used with a forklift platform that the platform is designed and constructed of material of sufficient strength, or if manufactured, is erected, used, maintained and dismantled with the manufacturer's specifications and is securely attached to the lift truck.</p>
