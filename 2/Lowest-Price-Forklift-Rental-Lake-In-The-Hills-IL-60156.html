<p>PA Industrial Equipment, Inc. HIGH-LIFT PLATFORM TRUCK: A self-loading truck equipped with a load platform, intended primarily for transporting and tiering loaded skid platforms (Fig. OSHA General Industry Standard 1910.178()(1) Only stable or safely arranged loads shall be handled. Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation to avoid tipovers and accidents.</p>
<p>For trucks with tilting forks, the forks should be horizontal of at full upward tilt, whichever is less stable. For independent movement, lifting and placement of discrete loads throughout a facility, a variety of motorized lift trucks or forklifts can be used. Obstructed vision also occurs with forklifts. While most advanced League City shade-tree mechanics can manage the installation of a body lift kit with the proper tools.</p>
<p>Linear speed control, an option on many competitors' trucks, is standard on all SP models and utilises a variable height sensor to measure platform height and determine the optimum speed level. Therefore, a truck's suspension has to be lifted and its components adjusted so everything fits and works well. Skilled forklift operators annually compete in obstacle and timed challenges at regional forklift rodeos.</p>
