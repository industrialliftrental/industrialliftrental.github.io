Having a lifted truck also helps you see traffic jams early on so that you can take the necessary steps to avoid them if necessary.

The best way to prevent rough terrain forklift-related injury, accidents or death is by getting educated, licensed and certified in Rough Terrain Forklift Training. It's really yes and no.
