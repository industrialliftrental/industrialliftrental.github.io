Nowadays, heavy duty forklifts are being used to transport bulky containers from delivery trucks to dockside storage regions and then to ships. Rough terrain forklifts rely on their masts to lift loads much higher than standard forklifts can.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these rough terrain forklifts double as workhorses in the bush here in Australia. The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. While they can lift several times their weight, the maximum weight that they can hold is significantly lower than that of class 1 models. The catch is that you do have to test for various types of lift trucks.</p>
