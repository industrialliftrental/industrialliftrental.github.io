<p>Weight capacity is an important detail when planning your forklift rental because you do not want to pay for a rental only to find that it cannot safely lift the loads you need to handle. This hybrid design gives operators the flexibility to program the truck to run on its own or operate manually as a traditional lift truck.

Our hand pallet trucks represent a cost-effective solution for many transport tasks involving short distances. But most warehouses are more sophisticated than that and require moving materials heavier and higher than a hand truck can go. They may use a fleet of forklifts, without any injury or accident to speak of.</p>
<p>The user should mark, on the sides of the truck, in letters at least 1½ in. high, the actual vehicle weight, the maximum load and the combined weight of the vehicle and capacity load. Because the dimensions of the machine, its weight, the counterbalance, and other elements will define the nominal load that the forklift can handle and lift. An additional set of wheels allows pallet truck to be moved sideways in addition to being the conventional forward and back directions.</p>
<p>As forklift operators need to sit in their machine for hours together, a high-quality adjustable seat is essential. Front suspension drop-down brackets, or a crossmember cradle, allow the vehicle's suspension pickup points to be relocated at a lower position, which allows the vehicle to be lifted without changing the suspension's travel and steering geometry.</p>
<p>Rent the forklift from a reputable company. Order picking operations are often faced with seasonal fluctuations in the number of trucks and operators they need. Did you know by changing the type of forklift you can get it to multitask, reducing costs and increasing ROI. Toyota's 7-series reach truck offers the industry's first AC Power System,along with Traction & Brake Control which gives improved traction, better braking and suspension control for more stability.</p>
