<p>Whilst there are some limitations - such as the electric battery and low ground clearance - if used in the correct manner a reach forklift can be a valuable addition to a savvy warehouse's equipment. Having order picker trucks will benefit for warehouses with narrow aisles and high racking.

Better off-roading performance. You can choose between a body lift kit, a suspension lift kit, and leveling lift kits.</p>
