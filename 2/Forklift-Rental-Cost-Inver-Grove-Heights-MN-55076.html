<p>Observe forklift operators in their daily work and take prompt corrective action to correct careless or unsafe operations. This is best if you have a large warehouse or need different types of lifts for the jobs you'll be doing.

While on the subject of suspension lifts, torsion bar twisting is an inexpensive method many people use to lift their truck, which may be OK for leveling, but it is not a true lift because it merely adjusts the level at which the truck sits in its suspension travel.</p>
