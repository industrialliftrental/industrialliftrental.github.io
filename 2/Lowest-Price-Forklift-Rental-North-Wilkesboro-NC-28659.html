<p>Texas First Rentals will remain open during the COVID-19 outbreak to safely serve customers across our territory. That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>
<p>Note: In order to receive your C4 Forklift Operation Certification, you must take and pass a performance evaluation given by your employer at your job site. It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable.</p>
<p>The truck should be equipped with the attachment and the test load (when required) should be representative of the capacity of the truck and attachment combination. So if you need additional materials handling equipment to keep your business up and running, we can help. If you find anything wrong with the forklift during the walk-around or seated inspection, do not operate it until it has been repaired.</p>
