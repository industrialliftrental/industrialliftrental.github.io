<p>Sometimes using a forklift for your pallet moving operation is like taking a bazooka to a knife fight. Many aftermarket lift kits provide CV spacers to move the stock axle outward, effectively lengthening it, but spacers aren't necessarily the best answer for the long haul. A properly loaded lift truck does not exceed the rated capacity of the truck as listed on the trucks data plate.</p>
<p>Standard Hand Hydraulic High Lift Pallet Truck is fabricated using fine grade raw materials and advanced technology. Keep in mind that body lifting can only raise vehicles from 1 to 3 inches total, which means you cannot get a huge lift from these kits. Always start the engine while seated in the operator's positionânever while standing alongside the forklift.</p>
