Forklifts come with safety equipment such as an overhead guard over the operator area in front of the mast and another protecting the driver's seat.</p>
<p>Compared to the internal combustion systems, the performance of AC trucks in parameters such as load-lift ability, ability to negotiate a ramp, acceleration, speed control on-ramps, and braking are gaining attraction of the industries. Because there is no load, the center of gravity is nearly in the center of the forklift's counterbalance. When you lift a truck or SUV, the lifting process typically involves adding new aftermarket performance parts such as brakes, shocks , bigger wheels , or tires to your truck.</p>
