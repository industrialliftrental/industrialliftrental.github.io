It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable.</p>
<p>These mobile, self-loading trucks are power-propelled to carry, push, pull, lift, stack or tier material. Reach trucks are used most in warehouses for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights. For example, additional viewing windows have been integrated for added safety and the control panel has been designed to be even more user-friendly.</p>
