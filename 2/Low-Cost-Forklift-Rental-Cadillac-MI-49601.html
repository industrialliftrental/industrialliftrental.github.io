Whether a complete beginner or an experienced operator, our range of forklift training benefits individuals or employees wanting to develop their skills. The late ‘70s body sits on a full custom tube sub-chassis with long travel, four-link suspension, heavy-duty axles, and tractor tires, although the only thing this truck is going to plow is a mud pit.</p>

The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck. If other tests or tests for trucks over 10,000 lb rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parries.</p>
