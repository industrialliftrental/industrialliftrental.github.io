<p>Order picking trucks have a working platform that helps the operator to control the lift. With lift capacities of 5,000, 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, respectively, the three established G Series rough-terrain forklift models offered by Case can be equipped with two mast heights — 15 and 22 feet — to cover most applications. Dayton hand hydraulic pallet trucks are manually operated industrial duty products designed to lift maximum weight.

The suspension lift kit helps drivers conquer uneven and off-road terrain.</p>
<h2>Fork Truck Warehouse Mentor</h2>
