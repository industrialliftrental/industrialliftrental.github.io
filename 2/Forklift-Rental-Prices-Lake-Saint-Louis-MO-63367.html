Operate trucks equipped with attachments as partially loaded trucks when not handling a load. The second type is a body lift kit, which raises your truck between one and three inches and allows you to keep your standard tires while giving them a wider margin from the body. In contrast, renting a rough terrain forklift can help you keep your costs in check.</p>
