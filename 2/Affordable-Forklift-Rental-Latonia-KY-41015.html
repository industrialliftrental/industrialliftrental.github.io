The Mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets. It is not uncommon for the lift axle to operate with a much smaller tire, however, the tire is often of a greater ply rating and able to support more weight than the larger truck tires.</p>
