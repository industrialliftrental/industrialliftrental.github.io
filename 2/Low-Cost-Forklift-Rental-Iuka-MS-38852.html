<p>We are offering Premium quality Heavy & Medium Load capacity hydraulic Hand Pallet truck. Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>
<p>Note: In order to receive your C4 Forklift Operation Certification, you must take and pass a performance evaluation given by your employer at your job site. It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable.</p>
<p>The truck should be equipped with the attachment and the test load (when required) should be representative of the capacity of the truck and attachment combination. So if you need additional materials handling equipment to keep your business up and running, we can help. If you find anything wrong with the forklift during the walk-around or seated inspection, do not operate it until it has been repaired.</p>
