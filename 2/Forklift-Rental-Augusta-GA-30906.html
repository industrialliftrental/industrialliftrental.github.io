<p>One of the main safety risks for order pickers is falling from height when exiting the cabin onto pallets, partially enclosed platforms or racking. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test OP1, or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. Knowing your specific needs and what forklift type best fits your application is very important when renting equipment for your job site.</p>

Our nationwide used forklift sales network brings refurbished lifts to companies and agencies at reasonable prices.
