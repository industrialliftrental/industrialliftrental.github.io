<p>AUSA Rough Terrain Forklifts are highly versatile machines capable of handling heavy loads and big volumes on rough and sloping terrain. You've seen the big ol' monster trucks on TV, laying waste to everything they drive over. Knowing your required lift height is equally important and will affect your unit's load-carrying capacity. The pallet jack is the little brother to the forklift Generally the heavier a pallet jack is, the more weight it can handle on its rated operating capacity.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with standard lift trucks, straight mast forklifts are essentially a cross between a forklift and an RTV. However, to maximize the benefits you can gain from a short-term forklift rental, you need to understand lift truck rental agreements and how they align to the needs of your specific business. The lifted suspension helps your truck better handle the rough nature of going off-road, plus the higher ground clearance means you won't bottom out as often.</p>
<p>It may be necessary to cover the surface of the tilting platform with a friction increasing material such as paint containing friction material, adhesive tape coated with friction material, or metallic safety tread” with perforated buttons. More commonly referred to as telehandlers, there are three different types of rough terrain forklifts: telehandlers, rotating telehandlers, and straight mast forklifts.</p>
