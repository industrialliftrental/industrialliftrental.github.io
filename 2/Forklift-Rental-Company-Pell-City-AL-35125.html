<p>Our rental fleet has over 900 rentals ready for use at short notice. Lifted trucks have a negative reputation for being unsafe, but that's simply untrue. Any time the forklift's center of gravity moves outside the stability triangle, the lift will tip over. Generally, the forklift's wheels and frame are designed for a specific tire type, so check the forklift's manual before going with a different tire type than what is recommended.</p>
