Collision hazards are a big concern for counterbalance forklifts. OSHA estimates that 110,000 forklift accidents take place every year at U.S. jobsites. Manufacturers of industrial trucks make a widespread contribution throughout the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>161 Rule: Vehicles will not be driven in and out of trucks trailers at unloading docks until trucks are securely blocked and brakes set. LOAD CENTER: The horizontal longitudinal distance from the intersection of the horizontal load-carrying surfaces and vertical load-engaging faces of the forks (or equivalent load positioning structure) to the center of gravity of the load.</p>

Lifting your truck provides some very useful benefits in addition to looking badass, but before performing this upgrade, be aware that you are significantly changing the functional operation of the vehicle.</p>
<p>Our rentals have the flexibility for daily, weekly or monthly rentals and allow you flexibility in your material handling needs. There are a lot of great reasons why you would want to rent a forklift versus buying one new. Class VI forklifts are sit-down rider, tow tractor lifts. Make sure that forklift operators are given formal instruction, hands on training and periodic evaluation.</p>

Our company, over the years, with its vast experience in this domain offers wide range of Heavy Duty Pallet Truck for various industrial uses. Suspension lifts, on the other hand, are installed as a part of the truck's suspension and can increase the height of a truck substantially, well over the three-inch limit of a body lift.</p>
