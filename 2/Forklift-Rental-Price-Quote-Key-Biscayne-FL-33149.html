<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. Due to its smaller forklift dimensions, the pallet jack is not capable of lifting heavy weight. Two or three forklifts are usually shipped on the same load to minimize the freight charges.

Because of the high initial cost, almost all forklifts are either rented or financed. Lift and remove various loads using the full working height of the forklift.
