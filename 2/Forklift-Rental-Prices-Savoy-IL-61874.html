The extra horsepower allows it to tackle a wide variety of terrain and reliably heft loads to great heights on unpaved and uneven surfaces. The top supplying country or region is China, which supply 100% of all terrain forklifts respectively. Almost all counterbalanced powered industrial trucks have a three-point suspension system.</p>
