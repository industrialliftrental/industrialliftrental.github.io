<p>Our forklifts are widely demanded by various industries like textile, warehouse, chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, aviation, glass, ceremics, construction, beverages, automobile OEM & its Ancillary unit. Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
<p>IN June, 1946, The American Society of Mechanical Engineers adopted a resolution to develop a safety code on powered industrial trucks. Rough terrain forklifts evolved from standard forklifts. A forklift rental can also be used for special projects and short term needs, without incurring long term costs and requiring unnecessary investment in equipment that may not be used all the time.</p>

Whether you're using the truck to commute to work every day or planning to carve your own path offroad, choosing the right lift kit is a crucial decision.
