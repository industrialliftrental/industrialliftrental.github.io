<p>PA Industrial Equipment, Inc. If you are currently operating order picking forklift trucks under supervision for at least six (6) months in any setting (e.g. transport and logistic industry) and wish to obtain a plant licence, bring a letter from the employer and sample pages of the order picker Logbook you have completed over this period (this will determine the time you should spend on studies - at home and at AWFTC).</p>
<p>Reach trucks aren't meant for moving loads long distances. If you're unable to find a pre-made lifted truck in your area, or if these vehicles are too expensive for your budget, you may have more luck modifying a truck yourself.

<p>The Raymond 5300 Orderpicker truck is the ultimate in order picking value. The 2X Series consists of two-wheel-steer models with lift capacities from 6,000 to 12,000 pounds, available in two- and four-wheel drive.
