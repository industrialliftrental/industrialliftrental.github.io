<p>PA Industrial Equipment, Inc. HIGH-LIFT PLATFORM TRUCK: A self-loading truck equipped with a load platform, intended primarily for transporting and tiering loaded skid platforms (Fig. OSHA General Industry Standard 1910.178()(1) Only stable or safely arranged loads shall be handled. Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation to avoid tipovers and accidents.</p>
<p>While a side loader can measure less than five feet wide to fit into narrow spaces, a counterbalance forklift may need up to 13 feet to easily turn and maneuver through aisles. Your 4×4 truck can be your ticket to off-road adventures, your daily driver around town, your hauling and towing machine, or your work truck. If everything looks sound, place the pallet jack in a designed storage area, with the handle locked in a raised position.</p>
<p>This is achieved by two outer legs which distribute the load weight and prevent the forklift from tipping. OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years. Technology makes today's RT forklifts safe, comfortable, and environmentally friendly.</p>

<p>When in doubt, ask an expert in the forklift rental industry for advice. Using the procedure outlined for the test, an empty truck with the forks elevated to the maximum height at which horizontal travel is permitted and for the travel speed allowable at that height, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified in Graph D, Curve 1.</p>
<p>Finishing off the list is Toyota rentals. Manual pallet jacks: As the name suggests, these jacks are hand-powered and designed to lift light to medium size loads over short distances. You can get a lifted truck at home with a lift kit, have it done professionally, or buy a truck that is already lifted. They are typically used for transporting palletized loads to and from the loading dock and storage area.</p>
<p>Equipped with our exclusive ACR System, the 5500 Orderpicker has lower maintenance and parts costs, fewer service requirements, increased battery performance, and superior truck utilization rates compared to DC-powered lift trucks.

Counterbalanced trucks are built to last longer between service intervals - up to 500 hours.</p>
