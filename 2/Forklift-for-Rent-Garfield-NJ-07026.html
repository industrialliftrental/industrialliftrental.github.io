Rent diesel or LP-gas forklift or rent a specialized material handling forklift, such as a truck-mounted forklift or piggyback truck. At CatÂ® Lift Trucks we design and build counterbalance forklift trucks for every application. It is rumored that electric forklifts are maintenance free due to less moving parts and their cleaner environments. Additionally Pengate rentals offer the following advantages: low rates (which include batteries and chargers); rental rates may be expensible for tax purposes; maintenance service by our Raymond Certified Technicians at no added charge; the ability to opt into a rent-to-own program.</p>
<p>Reach trucks are categorized as Class 2 lift trucks in material handling. The next huge advance in the forklift industry involved the electric engine. Electric forklifts are suited for indoor use and have several advantages. Forklifts help one person do the work of many when it comes to moving heavy pallets of goods inside a warehouse. Electric forklifts don't generate polluting emissions, and although they are usually the most expensive to buy, they are the cheapest in terms of operating costs.</p>
<p>These mobile, self-loading trucks are power-propelled to carry, push, pull, lift, stack or tier material. Reach trucks are used most in warehouses for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights. For example, additional viewing windows have been integrated for added safety and the control panel has been designed to be even more user-friendly.</p>

<p>No matter your application or your warehousing needs, we're sure to have a forklift truck that meets your requirements. One program is the World Industrial Trucks Statistics (WITS) which is published every month to the association memberships. For this reason, it is important to keep the center of gravity as near as possible to the center of the forks (remembering that the center of gravity may not be the geometric center if the load has irregular weight distribution).</p>

Electric counterbalanced truck shows that it has actually eclipsed the performance specifications of most internal combustion trucks. The test load should be equivalent to an unrestrained, homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension, and should equal in weight the rated capacity of the truck.</p>
