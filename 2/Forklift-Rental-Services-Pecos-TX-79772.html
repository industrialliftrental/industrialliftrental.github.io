<p>Their high capacity of up to three tons and easy manoeuvrability in tight spaces make hand pallet trucks the perfect warehouse aid.

<p>Caterpillar: Another recognizable name brand popular among construction and farming applications, Caterpillar telehandlers are reportedly capable of handling between 2,500 and 36,000 lbs, with track and multi-terrain loaders that heft 2,900 to 4,000 lbs.
