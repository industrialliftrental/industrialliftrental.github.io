This much weight would otherwise be too heavy for a standard 12,000 lb. truck to lift.

<p>My "beater" 4WD has a 3" lift kit that gives it about a 10" minimum ground clearance-more than enough clearance to handle some quite nasty trails-but I actually use my 4WD for both work and pleasure in areas where such capability is a necessity. This is expected to drive the demand for warehousing, which in turn, will drive the global Pallet Trucks market in the coming years.</p>

Forklifts can provide a huge productivity boost to a facility by giving workers a powerful, flexible mobile platform for transporting and storing heavy materials.

<p>Hyster forklifts are built tough, with cutting-edge technology and innovative designs. Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. Often, a driver will raise the axle to enable the vehicle to turn easier and not have to drag the lift axle sideways through a turn.</p>
