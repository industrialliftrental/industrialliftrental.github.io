<p>The weight of the forklift's battery can also be used to provide stability to the truck, so any change in the type of battery for the forklift can lead to instability.

With so many advantages being offered by the electric forklift and electric reach stacker, it's clear to see why these pieces of equipment are increasing in popularity in the material handling industry.</p>
<p>The majority of fatalities stem from forklift turnovers, so an obvious advantage of pushing a cart as opposed to sitting in a vehicle is not going down with the ship, so to speak, if it slips off a loading dock or tips due to an unbalanced load.
