From electric pallet jacks to narrow aisle lift trucks or sit-down rider forklifts, we'll help you find exactly what you need and get it to your facility when you need it.

<h2>Toyota Equipment Caledonia</h2>
<p>The order picker operator stands on a platform and moves up with the mast, unlike most lift trucks. By decreasing the air pressure, the driver can decrease the weight-carrying capacity of the axle or eliminate it completely by raising it up and off of the road. This is very important to the safety of the forklift operator. All parts are stainless including hydraulic pump, fork frame, handle, push rod, bearing, pin and bolt, etc.</p>

Another place where pallet trucks are very useful and can often be found is in loading docks.</p>
<p>An electronic narrow aisle forklift with an operator platform costs roughly $25,000 to $30,000. The whole purpose of lifting a truck is to increase the size of tire that can be installed, especially since increasing tire size is the only true way of gaining ground clearance at the axle. Discover how today's lift trucks and batteries are revolutionizing the way companies operate for tomorrow.</p>

<p>While lift kits can certainly increase utility, function and style for many truck owners, there are a few safety issues to consider first.

<p>There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front. Turret Trucks are battery operated machines that use both the electric engine, battery and operator compartment to counterweigh heavy loads. Safety on and off the road is the foremost issue concerning all lifted vehicles.</p>
<p>These types of forklifts are all hand controlled where the operator is in the front of the truck and controls the lift truck through a steering tiller. Driving with the load downhill can result in loss of the load and control of the forklift. At our GMC dealership near Rocky Mount and Goldsboro in Wilson, we offer professional upgraded lifted GMC trucks. You can also choose to fit the electric reach trucks with cabins for outdoor usage.</p>
<p>Provides material handling equipment. Raymond counterbalanced sit down forklift trucks can use specialized load handling attachments such as slip sheets, and carton clamps.
