<h3>Forklift Truck Hire Riverbank CA</h3>
<p>Forklifts have been lifting America's economy for over a century and we can now quantify our industry's economic contributions to the overall U.S. economy,‚Äù said Brett Wood , president and CEO of Toyota Material Handling North America and chairman of ITA. At Thompson Machinery, we've invested in a fleet of Cat forklifts, so you don't have to. Simply let us know when you need your forklift and for how long.</p>
<p>Weight capacity is an important detail when planning your forklift rental because you do not want to pay for a rental only to find that it cannot safely lift the loads you need to handle. This hybrid design gives operators the flexibility to program the truck to run on its own or operate manually as a traditional lift truck. The average lifespan of wooden pallets is approximately 3-5 years, which certainly isn't a short lifespan for a product that is constantly carrying heavy loads across the country.</p>
<p>Your solution: a high-capacity electric forklift. Capacity = The rating given a lift truck indicating the amount of weight that a truck will lift to a predetermined fork height at a specified load center.

<p>For high lift operations, the BT Reflex E-series features a unique tilting cab, which reduces driver strain whilst offering safer and more accurate load handling resulting in a high amount of pallet movement. But where a straight mast forklift really differs is in the maneuverability and accessibility it provides through large heavy-duty pneumatic cushion tires that enable the lift to traverse rough terrain as easily as any other equipment on the job site.</p>
<p>The additional height means your truck is more likely to flip and rollover in the event of a roadway emergency that involves tight handling. The hours of operation are more important than the year model when it comes to buying used forklifts. The purpose of a lift axle is to place the vehicle's total weight over a broader area, thereby allowing the vehicle to meet weight-imposed restrictions on certain roads.</p>
