<p>Weight capacity is an important detail when planning your forklift rental because you do not want to pay for a rental only to find that it cannot safely lift the loads you need to handle. This hybrid design gives operators the flexibility to program the truck to run on its own or operate manually as a traditional lift truck. The average lifespan of wooden pallets is approximately 3-5 years, which certainly isn't a short lifespan for a product that is constantly carrying heavy loads across the country.</p>

The hours of operation are more important than the year model when it comes to buying used forklifts. The purpose of a lift axle is to place the vehicle's total weight over a broader area, thereby allowing the vehicle to meet weight-imposed restrictions on certain roads.</p>
