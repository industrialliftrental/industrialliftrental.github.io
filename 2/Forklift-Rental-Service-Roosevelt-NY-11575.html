<p>The two main methods for lifting a truck are by doing a suspension lift or a body lift. So this is not the same type of lift as a body lift kit. Toyota Forklifts has introduced three new order pickers. Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers. What you need to do: Take a practical test where the forklift is driven around a suitable course and the operator will be required to move and stack various loads, the test will also include one to one verbal questioning.</p>
<p>The forklift is designed with a load limit for the forks which is decreased with fork elevation and undercutting of the load (i.e., when a load does not butt against the fork "L"). That's why many pallet trucks are barely wider than a pallet. Capable of handling heavy loads on all terrain types, Access Hire Australia's range of rough terrain forklifts are highly versatile machines.</p>

Newer vehicles sporting the latest in electronics often have a Vehicle Speed Sensor (VSS) which uses electronic sensors to tell the truck's computer how fast the truck is moving.</p>
