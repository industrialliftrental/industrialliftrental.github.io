<p>Quality parts for all lift trucks and all lift truck needs. Reaping those benefits, however, requires an array of skills and knowledge to operate these vehicles responsibly on site—skills and knowledge that have to be validated, either by third-party safety trainers, like myself, or by individuals who have attended training-the-trainer-type classes (more on this below), or by the vendors renting the equipment.</p>
<p>Stay up to date by perusing manuals, guides, and literature put out by the manufacturers of the forklifts as well as the industry leaders. Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension. Stand-up forklift trucks feature ComfortStance Suspension for a smoother ride.</p>
<p>We understand that your business experiences unique circumstances and equipment needs, and our convenient rental plans are designed to match your unique circumstances. Pallet jacks may seem simple enough to use, but no employee should operate a pallet jack unless they have been trained on safe operation of the pallet jacks used in their current workplace. Forklifts, at maximum, can only travel 8 mph or 3 mph around people, but even at that speed, one of these 4-ton vehicle's steel tusks can puncture your machinery and shut down your operation.</p>

<p>Electric forklifts are much quieter than LPG or diesel forklifts. A lifted truck or SUV can add style, utility and performance in a variety of situations, on and off-road, and if you're shopping for lift kits or if you've already committed to the work and extra expense it takes to put in a lift kit, you know that going the extra mile for safety and performance is just part of the deal.</p>
