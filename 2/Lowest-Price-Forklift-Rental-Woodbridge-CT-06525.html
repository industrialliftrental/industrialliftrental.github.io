Learn about the differences betweenelectric forklifts and internal combustion trucks in Indiana.</p>
<p>Reach trucks are categorized as Class 2 lift trucks in material handling. The next huge advance in the forklift industry involved the electric engine. Electric forklifts are suited for indoor use and have several advantages. Forklifts help one person do the work of many when it comes to moving heavy pallets of goods inside a warehouse. Electric forklifts don't generate polluting emissions, and although they are usually the most expensive to buy, they are the cheapest in terms of operating costs.</p>

The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight, which gives the extra 500 lb. capacity.

Daystar "Comfort Ride" Lift Kits combine the best of both worlds in order to give you the most optimal suspension lift all while staying within a reasonable budget. Many models of rough terrain forklifts are also 4-wheel drive.</p>
<p>Compared to the internal combustion systems, the performance of AC trucks in parameters such as load-lift ability, ability to negotiate a ramp, acceleration, speed control on-ramps, and braking are gaining attraction of the industries. Because there is no load, the center of gravity is nearly in the center of the forklift's counterbalance. When you lift a truck or SUV, the lifting process typically involves adding new aftermarket performance parts such as brakes, shocks , bigger wheels , or tires to your truck.</p>

Workplace type and conditions are also factors in hazards commonly associated with powered industrial trucks.

The operator should never use the forklift as a personal lift unless wearing the proper harness and safety equipment. At Alta Equipment Company, we offer a wide variety of heavy forklifts designed to tackle the toughest tasks.</p>

The other, more complex style of truck lift is a suspension lift kit.‚Äù The suspension lift requires more work to accommodate and usually costs a bit more.
