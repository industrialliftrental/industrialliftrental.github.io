Angled lower backrest provides the operator with a clear view of the fork tips, which makes it easier for the operator to insert the forks into a pallet.

<h3>Tips To Prolong The Lifespan Of Your Pallet Truck Grosse Pointe MI 48236</h3>
<p>Whilst there are some limitations - such as the electric battery and low ground clearance - if used in the correct manner a reach forklift can be a valuable addition to a savvy warehouse's equipment. Having order picker trucks will benefit for warehouses with narrow aisles and high racking. With a narrow chassis design and 360° steering, the reach trucks in the BT Reflex N-series offer increased flexibility.</p>
<p>When using them in a warehouse, it is important to bear in mind that the lifting height of these forklifts is usually limited to 24.6 feet and that the normal working aisle adapted to these elements must provide 10.5 feet to 11.5 feet of free space. Air Lift's products line include the "Air Lift 1000", "Ride Control 59500" and the "Load Lifter 5000" suspension air bags.</p>

Narrow aisle forklifts like walkie stackers and side loaders can measure less than 5 ft. However, if you are using a forklift in a warehouse setting, it is important to consider the aisle width.</p>
