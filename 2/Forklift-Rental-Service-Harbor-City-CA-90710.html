<p>Rough-terrain forklifts offer great versatility and are often called to fill a niche application. Suspension Lifts: For Pearland drivers searching for maximum lift, either for appearance enhancement or to survive on rugged terrain, a suspension lift is ideal.

<p>Buy used forklifts from the top manufacturers including Toyota, Cat, Komatsu, and more. Jacks feature 4mm-thick steel construction, with reinforced fork bracing and sealed ball bearings on wheels. The forks on a reach truck are attached to a pantograph mechanism that extends them forward to place in or retrieve pallets from warehouse racking.
