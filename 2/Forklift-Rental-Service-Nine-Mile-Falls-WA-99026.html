<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Check to make sure that the pallet jack is not on the cross wood of the skid, front wheels must be on the floor. In a forklift the operator sits on a seat with a seatbelt, a steering wheel and hand controls to move the lifting mechanisms. We offer certification on the Counterbalance Forklift from the following awarding bodies: RTITB, NPORS, CPCS, LANTRA. Our OSHA experts and training specialists are standing by to help you with all your counterbalance forklift training needs.</p>
<p>There are plenty of things to consider about how your truck will change after it's lifted. A walk-behind narrow aisle lift truck with a 3,000 to 4,000 pound capacity costs approximately $15,000 to $18,000. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida.</p>

Remember: you always want to buy a forklift that has a slightly higher load capacity than what you think you will need.</p>

It will mean you can drive 99% of all forklift trucks in the UK. As you already have experience, and the training is shorter, the cost for this is less than the beginner training.</p>
