<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height for the limit of travel speed, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified by Graph C about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
<p>Look out for any uneven surfaces that could result in technical difficulties for the stability and longevity of your reach forklift. Lifted cars have the potential to run right over smaller vehicles in the event of a high-speed accident. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident, because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.</p>
<p>When renting forklifts these points will help ensure your rental experience is safe, cost effective, and gets the job done. The durability of the PTH Series is enhanced by a reinforced lower handle, strong C-channel forks made of thick steel, cross braces and steel forgings on lift link arms and box-style pushrods. It should be noted that Lifted Trucks do have their drawbacks.</p>
