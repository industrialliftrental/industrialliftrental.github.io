<p>TYPES OF FORKLIFTS: fork crane models for industrial use within warehouses, hydraulic three-wheeled electric forklifts, etc. Whether it is while the order picker is moving up and down or during driving, the operator's entire body remains safely within the confines of the truck - aided, among other things, by compact steering and a generous cab area. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use.</p>
<p>Stay up to date by perusing manuals, guides, and literature put out by the manufacturers of the forklifts as well as the industry leaders. Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension. Stand-up forklift trucks feature ComfortStance Suspension for a smoother ride.</p>
<p>When you pick up the load ensure the load does not exceed the forklifts capacity. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the global Forklift Trucks Market. The Cat Lift Trucks Scholarship Program has awarded more than $130,000 in educational assistance to Houston-area students.

The types of conditions that order pickers work in are as varied as the different types of warehouses or distribution centers. Without a counterbalance license and counterbalance forklift license training, your employees aren't able to operate forklifts.</p>
<p>Double-Deep trucks are similar, but with longer forks, making them perfect for areas where multiple pallet loads are stored in each bay as they will reach right to the back of the bay. All of their forklifts have an excellent track record in terms of performance and safety. Do not pass under the raised portion of a forklift, regardless of the presence or absence of a load.</p>

Suitable for heavy-duty applications, our multidirectional reach truck is capable of handling both conventional pallets and long loads, such as steel beams and plastic pipes.</p>
