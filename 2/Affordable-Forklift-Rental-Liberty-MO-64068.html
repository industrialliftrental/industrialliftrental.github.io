Although forklifts are fairly easy machines to operate, it is recommended that all drivers receive proper forklift training and certification.

<p>You want to be sure you're getting the right piece of machinery for your specific business that will offer years of service and a large return on your investment. Counterbalanced forklifts carry their loads in front of their support point. Electric rider forklifts - These forklifts are available in stand-up and sit-down rider configurations. This allows for completion of work at heights that normal forklifts cannot reach.</p>
<h2>Narrow Aisle Lift Truck Liberty</h2>

This much weight would otherwise be too heavy for a standard 12,000 lb. truck to lift. Battery-operated reach trucks are gaining popularity among end use industries, owing to their ability to handle double pallet and horizontal transport.</p>
<p>Most rough terrain forklifts have ergonomic controls for easy, intuitive use. Forklift capacities often range from 3,000 - 7,000 lbs, meaning you can load at least 1,600 lbs on your pallet with the order picker.
