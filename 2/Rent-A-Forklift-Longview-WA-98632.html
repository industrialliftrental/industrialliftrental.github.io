<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height for the limit of travel speed, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified by Graph C about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position. This means the lift truck doesn't have to face the shelves—it can drive straight while still picking up loads to the side.</p>
