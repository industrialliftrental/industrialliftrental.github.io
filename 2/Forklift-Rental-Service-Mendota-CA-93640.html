With competitive rates, expert service, and lease terms to fit your needs, Indiana forklift rental has never been easier.</p>

<p>Many truck shoppers in the Lexington, Frankfort, Winchester, and Nicholasville area know they can count on Georgetown Auto Sales to give them a great selection of trucks, lifted or not, and a fair deal with honest sales. Considerations include forklift type, capacity, carriage type, and number of hydraulic functions (that power the attachment features). Using the procedure outlined for this test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which horizontal travel with unrestricted turning is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified in Graph D. Curve 1.</p>
<p>Counterbalanced forklifts are weighted at the rear to prevent the vehicle from tipping forward when lifting a load. Moving mast reach forklifts have a higher ground clearance due to larger wheels, but are unable to handle double deep racking responsibilities without a fork extension attachment. If these tests are used to determine capacity or alternate rated capacities, use appropriate loads and load centers instead of those herein specified.</p>
