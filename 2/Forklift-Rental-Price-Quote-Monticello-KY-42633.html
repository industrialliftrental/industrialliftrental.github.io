<p>No matter whether you are searching for a quality rough terrain forklift or a conventional forklift, it is always an excellent idea to shop around to get the best deal. Shoppers should be a bit concerned about lift blocks on the truck's rear axle as it is a tell that a cheap lift kit is being used. They offer straightforward operation and have dual forks at the front of the truck that lift and transport the loads.</p>
<p>A little more lifting capacity means the 3,500 lb. forklift can do more than the 3,000 lb. But you don't have to sacrifice the small footprint, as the truck sits on the same size frame. Trucks with electric steering include the Active Traction system with innovative hydraulics that adjusts the pressure on the traction tyre depending on loading conditions for faster travel speeds and better traction on ramps.</p>

Using the procedure outlined for the test, an empty truck with the forks elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck in standing is tilted to the slope specified in Graph E.</p>
