The traditional model of the forklift stability triangle is useful, but it leaves out one important thing: three-dimensional space. Stand-Up Rider = A lift truck designed to be controlled by an operator standing. But if the forklift is put in motion, or sits on a sloping surface, its center of gravity shifts.</p>
<p>Mariotti, maker of some of the smallest forklifts on the market, has options that are ideal for tight spaces and unusual applications (need to get through a small doorway or into an elevator?) or weight-sensitive work spaces like an old factory. The dual-mode pantograph robotic reach truck is the first such model available in North America and joins Yale's well-established dual-mode robotic lift truck lineup.</p>
