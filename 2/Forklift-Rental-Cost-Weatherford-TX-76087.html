The 2X Series consists of two-wheel-steer models with lift capacities from 6,000 to 12,000 pounds, available in two- and four-wheel drive.

Handling material can be a very tedious and tiring process. The pump ''top-of-stroke'' hydraulic fluid bypass minimizes stress on the system when the load is raised to maximum lift height.

<p>Forklifts have different shapes and sizes, also meet different and varied purposes. The hand pallet or lift truck has wheels located under the fork and uses a hydraulic jack for lifting and moving the pallets.

<p>We tailor rental agreements to deliver the equipment needed for the length of time that it is needed. Most rough terrain forklifts within this range are run by a single joystick that controls all boom functions and hydraulics for simple and efficient operation. These forklifts also run on diesel engines, which make them efficient to operate.
