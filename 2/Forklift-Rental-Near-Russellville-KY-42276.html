<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Check to make sure that the pallet jack is not on the cross wood of the skid, front wheels must be on the floor.

When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. While you'll typically use a rough terrain forklift outdoors, some models can operate indoors. They may be a bit worn out, so when the lift is installed, the proposed 2 inch leaves may only have lifted the truck 1.5 inches.</p>
