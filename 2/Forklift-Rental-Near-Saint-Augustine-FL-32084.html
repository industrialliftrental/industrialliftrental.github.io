<p>In the United States, approximately one person is killed in a forklift accident every 3 days on average. Similar to standard counterbalanced forklifts, NA and VNA lifts can support from 3,000 to 12,000 lbs and are available in a range of three or four-stage masts that offer lift heights up to 31 feet, as well as multiple chassis designs. The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>

<p>Remember, the operator is responsible for the safe operation of the forklift. Keep in mind that the higher you are lifting a load the lower the capacity will become.

Our Forklift Order Picker Cages assist in warehouse applications where goods are packed and picked at elevated heights.</p>
<p>It may be necessary to travel long distances with the load to the rear in reverse for most forklifts.
