The Mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets. It is not uncommon for the lift axle to operate with a much smaller tire, however, the tire is often of a greater ply rating and able to support more weight than the larger truck tires.</p>
<p>Step 3: Choose Your Truck's Lift Height. In 2000, OSHA issued an ergonomics standard. Skids were the first pallets ever produced, appearing in American factories along with low-lift trucks in the late 1880s. These compact truck models are suitable for material handling applications that demand high performance and travel.

Orderpickers will be used in applications where pallet trucks, rolling ladders, and other piece-picking methods are traditionally used.</p>
