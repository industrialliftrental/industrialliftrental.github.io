<p>The most recent report from the Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM) points to a plateauing of sales in the main market sectors for rough-terrain forklifts and telehandlers, at least in the USA. In an Order Picking Forklift the Operator goes up into the air with the load and either places pallets mechanically, or moves smaller loads on and off the order picker manually.</p>
<p>In addition to simply driving a fork lift, working as a fork lift operator requires the ability to properly lift, balance, and stack heavy loads that are ordinarily arranged on a wood pallet or a pallet made from other materials. High-level order pickers enable an operator to pick cases or items from 20 feet to 35 feet. Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
<p>In the past this job was done with either ladders, a dangerous and ineffective solution, or with reach trucks with goods on pallets and blocked aisles. The lifting forks rise up to 31.5 inches, which saves the operator unnecessary bending and heavy lifting and increases efficiency in repetitive handling operations. These fees are based on the length of the time you have your rental.</p>
