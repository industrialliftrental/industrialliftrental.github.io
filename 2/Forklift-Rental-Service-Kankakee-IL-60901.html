We offer competitive prices for all of our rental services, and several different tool rental rate options for your convenience. If you need large containers or heavy materials moved on such a site, you'll need the powerful engine and large tractor wheels of an all-terrain forklift. Dimensioning devices - fork truck-mounted dimensioning systems provide dimensions for the cargo to facilitate truck trailer space utilization and to support warehouse automation systems.</p>
<p>Raymond's ACR System (advanced AC motor control system) delivers powerful AC drive and lift that reduces downtime and increases warehouse productivity enabling faster, smoother operation while increasing operator confidence and lowering total cost of ownership.

<h2>The Benefits of Choosing a Forklift Lease Agreement in Kankakee </h2>

Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks.</p>

Having an order picker licence and forklift licence combined is a huge advantage when looking for work in the warehouse industry.
