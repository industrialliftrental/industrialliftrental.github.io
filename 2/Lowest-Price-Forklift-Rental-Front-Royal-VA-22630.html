The AM30, on the other hand, can easily handle heavy loads thanks to its 3000 kg capacity. Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. With excellent machine and load stability due to an optimum centre of gravity and suspension provided by large diameter tyres, these machines provide high mobility and great productivity in rough terrain environments.</p>
<p>They can weather any environment and derive fuel from multiple sources, but they do not have the unique capacities that reach forklifts do.

They should also know the potential risks for each model.</p>
<p>The average weight of the load your forklift is going to handle. We've engineered the H Series forklifts to be the best at both.

CLARK Material Handling Corporation built the Tructractor, and have maintained a presence in the forklift field ever since then. Adding a Pro Comp lift kit to your vehicle will help to maintain vehicle ride height, reduce the effect of shock forces, maintain wheel alignment, support loaded weight, and control the direction of travel for your truck or SUV.</p>
