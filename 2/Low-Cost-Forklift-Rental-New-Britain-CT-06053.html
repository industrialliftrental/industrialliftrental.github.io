Reaping those benefits, however, requires an array of skills and knowledge to operate these vehicles responsibly on site—skills and knowledge that have to be validated, either by third-party safety trainers, like myself, or by individuals who have attended training-the-trainer-type classes (more on this below), or by the vendors renting the equipment.</p>

<p>Rentals are a repeat business - your customers only rent your equipment for a period of time, so if they need it again in the future they have to rent again.

Your rental supplier can provide you with operator training for an additional fee if you require this training for your drivers.
