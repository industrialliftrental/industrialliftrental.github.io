<p>Our forklifts are widely demanded by various industries like textile, warehouse, chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, aviation, glass, ceremics, construction, beverages, automobile OEM & its Ancillary unit. Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
<p>Reach trucks are categorized as Class 2 lift trucks in material handling. The next huge advance in the forklift industry involved the electric engine. Electric forklifts are suited for indoor use and have several advantages. Forklifts help one person do the work of many when it comes to moving heavy pallets of goods inside a warehouse. Electric forklifts don't generate polluting emissions, and although they are usually the most expensive to buy, they are the cheapest in terms of operating costs.</p>
<p>The main safety concern pertains to the lifted vehicle's bumper height from the ground. In addition to this, reach forklifts can be fitted with a camera that shows the driver what is happening above their head on a video screen. But palletisation really enhances the material handling efficiency and throughput. Rough terrain forklifts are larger, stronger and more durable and hence they are pricey than the average forklift.</p>
