Whether you're using the truck to commute to work every day or planning to carve your own path offroad, choosing the right lift kit is a crucial decision. Not all kits are created equal, and a rough-riding rig can add to fatigue on long trips, make controlling the vehicle exhausting, and put wear on the truck itself.</p>

<p>Counterbalanced forklifts are weighted at the rear to prevent the vehicle from tipping forward when lifting a load. Moving mast reach forklifts have a higher ground clearance due to larger wheels, but are unable to handle double deep racking responsibilities without a fork extension attachment. If these tests are used to determine capacity or alternate rated capacities, use appropriate loads and load centers instead of those herein specified.</p>

Industrial lift truck is defined in regulation as: a self-propelled vehicle used to carry, lift, stack, tier, push or pull material. Like most other lifts, a counterbalance forklift has a pair of forks in front of the vehicle.</p>
<p>Stand-up trucks are the most common and are often used where there's only one load per bay. Cargo type - You need to consider factors like the packaging of your cargo, the type of pallets used, and whether or not the load has a unique shape. The machine also provides a maximum load capacity of 5,000 pounds. Some of our forklift dealers carry rough terrain forklifts, telehandlers and scissor lifts.</p>
