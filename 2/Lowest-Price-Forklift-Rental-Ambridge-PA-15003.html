<p>Remember, the operator is responsible for the safe operation of the forklift. Keep in mind that the higher you are lifting a load the lower the capacity will become. No forklift operator can predict every possible event. Use high-quality assembly from industry's mature suppliers to ensure the function of the truck's power system and its stability. Our Forklift Order Picker Cages assist in warehouse applications where goods are packed and picked at elevated heights.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you're just commuting to Reading, PA or trying to explore new lengths off the beaten path, you'll get a lot more visibility when you are driving a lifted truck or Jeep. These forklifts come in two tire types: ICE pneumatic tires which are designed for outdoor use or indoors that have rough surfaces, and ICE cushion tires which are ideal for indoor spaces with concrete surfaces.</p>
<p>As forklift operators need to sit in their machine for hours together, a high-quality adjustable seat is essential. Front suspension drop-down brackets, or a crossmember cradle, allow the vehicle's suspension pickup points to be relocated at a lower position, which allows the vehicle to be lifted without changing the suspension's travel and steering geometry.</p>
<p>Some smaller industrial forklifts are powered by an electric motor running off an internal battery. Unlike most car repairs or upgrades, lifting a truck requires a little more effort than getting a few gearhead friends together on a Sunday afternoon to gather around a toolbox and a twelve-pack. At Frank Kent CDJR, we have used lifted trucks for sale, and our expert service staff can install lift kits into one of our new or used pickups for you.</p>
