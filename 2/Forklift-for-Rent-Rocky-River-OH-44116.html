<p>Electric forklift not holding charge? Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.). The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>
<p>Reliable and easy-to-use, our all-terrain forklifts for hire provide great performance for your workplace. Apart from the manufacturers, various truck associations are also participating in taking necessary initiatives that can help to enhance the productivity and safety concerns of the lift trucks operations. If you're an adventurous individual or desire a truck with serious size and power, then you definitely should test drive one of our lifted trucks.</p>

<p>Choose from corrosion-resistant pallet jacks for demanding environments, or all-terrain jacks for navigating various types of ground surfaces. Using the procedure outlined for the test, an empty truck with the forks elevated 12 inches from the test platform measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified in Graph D, Curve 1.</p>
<p>Counterbalanced forklifts are weighted at the rear to prevent the vehicle from tipping forward when lifting a load. Moving mast reach forklifts have a higher ground clearance due to larger wheels, but are unable to handle double deep racking responsibilities without a fork extension attachment. If these tests are used to determine capacity or alternate rated capacities, use appropriate loads and load centers instead of those herein specified.</p>
