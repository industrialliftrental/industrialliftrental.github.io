<p>BJ's Rentals, Inc. Rapid development of vertical tower forklifts for industrial use was adapted to rough terrain forklifts as well. First, the fact that your forklift is rented means that you aren't solely responsible for its upkeep and maintenance.

In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation.</p>
