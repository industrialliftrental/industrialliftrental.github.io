<p>Operate powered industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities. LPM Forklift Sales & Service in Oklahoma and Texas offers a variety of forklifts and material handling equipment for sale, including pallet jacks, hand pallet trucks, tow tractors, walkie stackers, order pickers, narrow aisle forklifts, warehouse forklifts and heavy forklifts from Unicarriers, Linde, Manitex Lift King and Barrett Industrial Trucks.</p>
<p>These forklifts are known for what their name indicates, their ability to lift loads at a high altitude. Because of these possibilities, operators should be careful to keep the center of gravity firmly within the stability triangle. Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, with the superior quality in ride characteristics of a system like the Range Rover air suspension and Lincoln Navigator airride, the one downfall is durability.
