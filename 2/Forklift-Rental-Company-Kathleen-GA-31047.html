Also for rent, sit-down, stand-on or walk-behind forklifts.</p>

<p>Rentals are a repeat business - your customers only rent your equipment for a period of time, so if they need it again in the future they have to rent again. A forklift that cannot tolerate the amount of weight to the proper height is not only a waste of time and money, but very dangerous. Learn more about the benefits of a long-term equipment rental and whether it's a good choice for your company.</p>

<p>Kalmar's years of experience in extreme applications all over the world have provided the knowledge needed to perfect the most heavy duty lifting equipment available on the market. For example a pallet jack is not the same as a three-wheel counterbalance lift truck yet they are both classed as a forklift. This means that Linde reach trucks can maneuver safely and quickly, even in confined spaces and handling conditions in warehouses.</p>
<p>Most custom lifted trucks are purely aesthetic, even the height of the lift. Most standard forklifts can reach heights between 10 and 15 ft, but special forklifts like the telehandler can lift as high as 55 ft depending on the telehandler size you select. The huge demand for lift trucks for material handling equipment across several industries such as construction, mining, and food & beverage will favor the growth of the lift trucks market in the Asia Pacific.</p>
