<p>Looking to rent material handling equipment in Phoenix? Furthermore, the type of the load does matter and there are specific forklift attachments that can improve a standard forklift and aid you in moving the load more resourcefully. Not work on a forklift platform unless the industrial lift truck is on a firm flat surface and the platform is equipped with guardrails or a travel restraint system or fall-arresting system.</p>
