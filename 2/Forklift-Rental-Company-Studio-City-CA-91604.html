<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height for the limit of travel speed, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified by Graph C about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
<p>Manitou MSI 30: The diesel-powered MSI 30 offers an impressive maximum load capacity of 6,000 pounds. The comprehensive range of order picker models and options extends the choice of truck configuration to provide the best solution for each customer's application and to maximize pick face access and warehouse space utilization.

<p>We understand that your business experiences unique circumstances and equipment needs, and our convenient rental plans are designed to match your unique circumstances. Pallet jacks may seem simple enough to use, but no employee should operate a pallet jack unless they have been trained on safe operation of the pallet jacks used in their current workplace. Forklifts, at maximum, can only travel 8 mph or 3 mph around people, but even at that speed, one of these 4-ton vehicle's steel tusks can puncture your machinery and shut down your operation.</p>

<p>To eliminate the chance of combustion, all electrical components in an explosion-proof forklift are completely sealed. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Rough terrain forklifts are designed for two things: lifting and moving loads.</p>
