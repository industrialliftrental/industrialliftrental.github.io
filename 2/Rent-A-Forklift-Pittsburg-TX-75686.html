<p>A truck that has had its suspension modified so that it rides way too far off the ground, usually to the point where the high center of gravity could actually be dangerous. Using the procedure outlined for the test, an empty truck with the forks elevated to any height up to the maximum height at which horizontal travel is permitted, and for the travel speed allowable at that height, should not overturn when the test platform, and for the travel speed allowable at that height, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified by Graph D, Curve 1, for unrestricted turning and by Graph D, Curve 2, for straight forward and reverse travel, travel, no turning ± 10 degrees.</p>

<p>Step 3: Choose Your Truck's Lift Height. In 2000, OSHA issued an ergonomics standard. Skids were the first pallets ever produced, appearing in American factories along with low-lift trucks in the late 1880s. These compact truck models are suitable for material handling applications that demand high performance and travel.
