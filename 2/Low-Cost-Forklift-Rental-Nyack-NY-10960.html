<p>Gas forklifts constantly need to be refilled, so the recurring need to purchase fuel makes the long-term costs hefty. Forklifts vary in size, ranging from one ton capacity for general warehouse related work to 50 ton capacity for shipping container work. Whereas the standard order pickers have fixed forks that can only be driven in or out of the pallet, the swing-reach's forks can approach pallets from a variety of positions.</p>

This decreased load center is specified, recognizing that loads may be handled which have a higher density and therefore, shorter load center than the truck rating.</p>

These lift trucks are designed to maximize unit load capacity by narrowing aisles and promoting product throughput.
