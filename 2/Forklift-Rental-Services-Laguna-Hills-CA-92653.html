<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Check to make sure that the pallet jack is not on the cross wood of the skid, front wheels must be on the floor. In a forklift the operator sits on a seat with a seatbelt, a steering wheel and hand controls to move the lifting mechanisms. We offer certification on the Counterbalance Forklift from the following awarding bodies: RTITB, NPORS, CPCS, LANTRA. Our OSHA experts and training specialists are standing by to help you with all your counterbalance forklift training needs.</p>
<p>When ordering or reordering forks, make sure you are getting high quality forks that will do your lifting jobs safely. Let us help you find the perfect buyer for your forklift. If you've ever wondered why some drivers lift their trucks, you're in the right place. With the test load elevated to the maximum height for the limit of travel speed without change in the original load overhang dimensions, the test platform should be tilted to the specified slope in Graph C.</p>
<p>It is good practice to keep the load back against the truck mast as much as possible. If you're looking specifically for Toyota forklifts, this is where you need to look. Ensure loads are stacked evenly on the forks before moving the pallet jack. ICE forklifts can handle loads of up to 15,500 pounds and are ideal for indoor operation on smooth floors. Although there are several different ways in which trucks can be lifted, most methods fall into one of two categories: body lifts and suspension lifts.</p>

<p>With a load capacity of 2 tonnes, this flexible, low lifting hand pallet truck saves time and effort, allowing operators to weigh pallets and containers during loading and transport for maximum efficiency.
