Some small work zones and warehouses require a compact-sized forklift for safe maneuvering and material handling, while more demanding loads require a heavy-duty model designed for maximum lifting power or extra height.</p>

You'll catch this guy out in the mud pits dwarfing trucks that would make your crew cab long bed look like a lowrider.
