<p>Rough terrain forklifts have the ability to tackle a wide range of site conditions - from pavement and hills to mud and back again. Nowadays, heavy duty forklifts are being used to transport bulky containers from delivery trucks to dockside storage regions and then to ships. Rough terrain forklifts rely on their masts to lift loads much higher than standard forklifts can.</p>

The lifted suspension helps your truck better handle the rough nature of going off-road, plus the higher ground clearance means you won't bottom out as often.</p>
