<p>Welcome to the home of Doosan Forklifts in the UK. Operating a rough terrain forklift exposes you to many hazards. For individuals who do exclusively on-road driving and no hauling, the only noticeable benefit is the lifted line of sight and boosted aesthetic.

Lifted trucks draw attention from everyone on the road and act as giant billboards at local shows, putting that paintjob high up in the sky for everyone to see.</p>
