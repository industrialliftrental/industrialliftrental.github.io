While it's important to go into any major mechanical change with eyes wide open, if you are truly interested in having a lifted truck, let your dreams come true.</p>
<p>In addition to simply driving a fork lift, working as a fork lift operator requires the ability to properly lift, balance, and stack heavy loads that are ordinarily arranged on a wood pallet or a pallet made from other materials.
