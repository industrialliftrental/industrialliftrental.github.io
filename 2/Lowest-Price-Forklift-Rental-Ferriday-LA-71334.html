<p>The desire to own the biggest, baddest, shiniest forklift fresh off the assembly line is understandable. When ascending or descending grades in excess of 10 percent, loaded trucks shall be driven with the load upgrade. Our knowledgeable staff will help you find the right Hyster or Yale forklift, lift truck, aerial work platform, or other top-tier material handling equipment to augment your fleet.

<p>This internal transport equipment makes loading and unloading more efficiently, which results in a more productive working day. The 3,500 lb. forklift uses the same body style as the 3,000 lb. The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight, which gives the extra 500 lb. capacity. We offer lifted trucks across a variety of models and trim levels, so no matter if you're shopping for a baseline full-size pickup or an upgraded heavy duty model, you can secure whichever you need with a lifted upgrade.</p>

With a complete range of rental plans to choose from, greater flexibility in handling operational peaks and troughs, and predictable costs, rentals can make both commercial and financial sense.</p>
<p>If you imagine all three points connected into a triangle, this is the forklift's stability triangle. A large suv or more often truck that has had longer suspension components nailed on it to increase ground clearance. A lifted suspension, though it's protected from scraping over rocks and debris, responds differently to this stress; if you lift your Jeep's suspension, your standard shocks might not do the trick.</p>
<h2>Reach Truck Ferriday</h2>
<p>Beyond that, many workers can also be injured when (1) lift trucks are inadvertently driven off loading docks; (2) lifts fall between docks and an unsecured trailer; (3) they are struck by a lift truck; or (4) they fall while on elevated pallets and tines.

You can learn to operate the Construction Lift (Class 7 ), or add Warehouse Lift (Class 1,4,5) , Reach Lift (Class 2), Order Picker (Class 2) or Walkie-Rider (Class 3) lifts for an additional charge.</p>

They feature specially-designed lifting carriages and come in two configurations: with mast and with reach.</p>

These trucks can be set up with work-saver forks which are approximately 9” wide and the trucks only lift pallet a few inches off the ground. Our machines are tough and will get the job done, but be sure to check out our other used 4-wheel forklifts for sale if you're looking for more options.</p>
