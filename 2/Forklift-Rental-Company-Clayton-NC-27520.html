<p>We carry a variety of pallet jacks, narrow aisle lift trucks, order pickers, and other cushion tire forklifts. The life of Hand Pallet truck as in the case of any other warehouse equipment depends on the usage and the type of load and surface. At SFS, there is a Hand pallet truck to suit every business need. So we have, on the one hand, electric forklifts and, on the other, internal combustion.</p>
<p>A little more lifting capacity means the 3,500 lb. forklift can do more than the 3,000 lb. But you don't have to sacrifice the small footprint, as the truck sits on the same size frame. Trucks with electric steering include the Active Traction system with innovative hydraulics that adjusts the pressure on the traction tyre depending on loading conditions for faster travel speeds and better traction on ramps.</p>
<p>Telescopic forks - hydraulic attachments that allow the operator to operate in warehouse design for "double-deep stacking", which means that two pallet shelves are placed behind each other without any aisle between them. Attachments can be used with forklifts to make the work easier and add additional functions. SFS's Hand Pallet truck can also be used for carrying small non palletised loads with suitable improvisation to hold the load on the forks.</p>
<p>Do not tow or push railway cars or trucks with a forklift. 35 inches or bigger is the common size range for determining whether or not a truck is truly a lifted truck. Add on a 6-inch lift kit and 35-inch tires on 20-inch wheels, and it's simply massive. An alternative to class 3s, tuggers can pull large loads without requiring the equipment to lift it off the ground to do it. This class is used on high traffic sites such as airport landing strips and luggage collection as they are easier to maneuver than a full forklift.</p>
