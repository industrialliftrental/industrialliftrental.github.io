Frequency of use and pallet transport distance should be taken into consideration when choosing between manual and electric pallet trucks.</p>
<p>These trucks are required for loading and unloading the materials and carrying it from one place to another. These drivers should not forego lifted trucks, but should consider a lower height that would accomplish their goal without exceeding what is necessary.
