<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height for the limit of travel speed, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified by Graph C about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
<p>In order to prevent the lift from tipping, the combined center of gravity of the load and the lift must stay inside the stability triangle (at ground level) at all times. If you are looking for good-conditioned forklifts from a reliable company, contact Ready Machinery Movers. Don't expect a forklift to handle like a car or truck. The best lift kits have fairly new if not brand new arched springs with suitable length to prevent odd shackle angles.</p>

While many people do lift their trucks strictly for appearance's sake, the main reason to do it is to increase ground clearance and to get the body, frame, and differentials higher.

<p>For off road purposes, lifting a truck is the best way to improve its performance. There is nothing like the ride that is achieved from air suspension.

<p>These forklifts are best when you use the vehicle for a set time each day. The Class I, Class II, and Class IV have a moderated growth rate over the forecast period as end-users are largely adopting Class III and Class V Forklift Trucks for the various applications. The reason that these trucks are ideally suited for off road driving is that the body of the truck is protected by the fact that it's several feet away from the ground, meaning that it's less likely to come into collision with the ground or other objects on the ground.</p>
