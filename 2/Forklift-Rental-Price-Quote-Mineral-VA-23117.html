Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load at maximum elevation and at maximum rearward tilt permitted by the truck mechanism, at that elevation, shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope about an axis parallel to a line connecting the center or either load wheel tire (or outermost tire where multiple tires are used) and the projection perpendicular to the platform of the point of intersection of the longitudinal centerline of the truck and centerline of the steering wheels.</p>
