<p>Scenario: You're in the market for a new forklift in Indianapolis You know specifically that you need an electric lift truck with cushion tires that can lift loads up to 4,500 lbs. With the walking operator facing in the direction of travel, with the load trailing, clockwise movement of the steering tongue shall steer the truck clockwise.

Generally, the forklift's wheels and frame are designed for a specific tire type, so check the forklift's manual before going with a different tire type than what is recommended.</p>
<p>The test load should be equivalent to an unrestrained, homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension and should equal in weight the rated capacity of the truck. Get the material handling equipment your business needs, on your schedule. Rough terrain forklifts have increased traction on the tyres for navigation over poor terrain.</p>
