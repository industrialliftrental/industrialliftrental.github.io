<p>No matter your brand, the team at Nations Trucks has a lifted truck that's calling your name. It's not always in the budget to make capital investments like buying new or used forklifts for your material handling operations. However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift. The machine known as an orderpicker is an electric lift truck specifically designed for filling individual customer orders which require piece-part or case picking, rather than full pallets or unit loads.</p>
<p>In addition to simply driving a fork lift, working as a fork lift operator requires the ability to properly lift, balance, and stack heavy loads that are ordinarily arranged on a wood pallet or a pallet made from other materials. High-level order pickers enable an operator to pick cases or items from 20 feet to 35 feet. Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
