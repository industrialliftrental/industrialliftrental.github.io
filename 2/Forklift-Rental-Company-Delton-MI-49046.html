This type of mast is common in rental fleets and just about anywhere else that uses forklifts.</p>
<p>When using them in a warehouse, it is important to bear in mind that the lifting height of these forklifts is usually limited to 24.6 feet and that the normal working aisle adapted to these elements must provide 10.5 feet to 11.5 feet of free space. Air Lift's products line include the "Air Lift 1000", "Ride Control 59500" and the "Load Lifter 5000" suspension air bags.</p>
