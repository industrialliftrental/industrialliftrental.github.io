<p>A parking mechanism shall be provided and capable of holding the truck on the maximum grade which the truck can negotiate with rated capacity load, or on a 15 percent grade, whichever is the lesser. Larger tires and wheels have much more mass that will need stronger and larger brakes in order to allow the vehicle to safely come to a complete stop. Additionally, if you're towing a heavy load, a lifted suspension provides the benefit of having more room to settle before the weight of the load bottoms out.</p>
<p>Some of the pallet trucks also independently reduce high speeds when cornering, adjust their drive behavior to the current situation, or help when climbing gradients. There will be a gap between the body and the frame of the truck, which can be covered with a gap guard to protect the exposed mechanicals.Suspension lifts are used to get that super-mega-monster truck look.</p>
