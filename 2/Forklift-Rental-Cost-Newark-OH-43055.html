The 2X Series consists of two-wheel-steer models with lift capacities from 6,000 to 12,000 pounds, available in two- and four-wheel drive.

Body lift kits are primarily used to lift up a truck or SUV either two or three inches higher. The forklift network carries high-quality equipment in all 50 states and 3 countries.</p>
<p>In addition to simply driving a fork lift, working as a fork lift operator requires the ability to properly lift, balance, and stack heavy loads that are ordinarily arranged on a wood pallet or a pallet made from other materials. High-level order pickers enable an operator to pick cases or items from 20 feet to 35 feet. Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
<p>We have hundreds of used forklifts for sale. Choosing the right suspension lift kit for your vehicle can be confusing at times.

Before you even pick up a pallet, the jack has a base weight that should be factored into any maximum weight restrictions for certain surfaces, such as lift gates or container floors. From moving products on and off trucks, to storing them in a warehouse, it takes a lot of energy.</p>
