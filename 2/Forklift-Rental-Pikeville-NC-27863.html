<p>A lifted truck, often referred to as a 4x4 truck, is a modified vehicle specially designed for off road driving and other types of high-impact work. More and more drivers from Phoenix to Glendale and everywhere in between are in the market for a pre-owned vehicle over shopping for a new car, truck or SUV. There are three known types of industrial reach forklifts: stand-up trucks, double-deep trucks, and straddle trucks.</p>
<p>It's called the HERC, one of the company's four different series of vertical-mast forklifts comprised of 12 core models.
