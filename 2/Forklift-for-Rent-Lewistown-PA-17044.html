<p>Reaching the quarter-million unit mark in sales is a major milestone for the industry,” said Brian Feehan, president of the Industrial Truck Association (ITA). However, suspension lift kits let the truck owners lift their truck as high as they want. Now, when there is no load present, the lift truck's center of gravity is firmly inside the triangle. The growth is driven by the increasing demand for battery-operated trucks and development of the warehouse segment across the region.</p>

<p>No matter your brand, the team at Nations Trucks has a lifted truck that's calling your name. It's not always in the budget to make capital investments like buying new or used forklifts for your material handling operations. However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift. The machine known as an orderpicker is an electric lift truck specifically designed for filling individual customer orders which require piece-part or case picking, rather than full pallets or unit loads.</p>
<p>With a standard side shift of 3" in either direction and the optional power positioning forks, operators can precisely place their loads. De-ration or reducing the forklift's nominal capacity can help get the figures right. An order picker is an appropriate lift truck for any operation that deals with many SKUs and not a lot of quantity of any particular SKU number.</p>

<p>Reach Truck = A truck equipped with a pantograph-type reach mechanism that allows the forks to extend out past the supporting outriggers. Lifted trucks are never seen in New England, the New York area, the Miami area, or Hollywood. It would be a nightmare in New York City, but Nashville's spread out communities are made for vehicles like The Beast, and it fits right in if you drive an hour outside the city.</p>
<p>Kalmar's years of experience in extreme applications all over the world have provided the knowledge needed to perfect the most heavy duty lifting equipment available on the market. For example a pallet jack is not the same as a three-wheel counterbalance lift truck yet they are both classed as a forklift. This means that Linde reach trucks can maneuver safely and quickly, even in confined spaces and handling conditions in warehouses.</p>

Most standard forklifts can reach heights between 10 and 15 ft, but special forklifts like the telehandler can lift as high as 55 ft depending on the telehandler size you select. The huge demand for lift trucks for material handling equipment across several industries such as construction, mining, and food & beverage will favor the growth of the lift trucks market in the Asia Pacific.</p>
