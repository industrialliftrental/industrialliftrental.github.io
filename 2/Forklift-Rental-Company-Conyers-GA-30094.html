Established in 1992, the National Plant Operators Registration Scheme is now one of the UK's leading Accreditation and Registration Bodies, working across the Construction, Industrial, Utilities, Warehousing and Distribution, Agricultural, Ports and Marine sectors. These trucks are very efficient in transporting heavy to very heavy materials from one place to another.</p>
<p>Telescopic forks - hydraulic attachments that allow the operator to operate in warehouse design for "double-deep stacking", which means that two pallet shelves are placed behind each other without any aisle between them. Attachments can be used with forklifts to make the work easier and add additional functions. SFS's Hand Pallet truck can also be used for carrying small non palletised loads with suitable improvisation to hold the load on the forks.</p>
<p>The larger ground clearance allows you to install larger tires and perhaps the best part of all is that your truck will handle the same or better than it did before depending on the type of kit you install. It may be tempting to buy one of the lifted trucks for sale in Phoenix without test driving it. But don't do it. Lifted cars can cost hundreds to thousands of dollars more So, if you are going to buy one, it's only fair that you test it out first.</p>
