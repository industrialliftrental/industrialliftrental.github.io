<h2>Pallet Jacks At Best Price In Sammamish </h2>
<p>Pengate has hundreds of rental units available from our service centers in York, Pittsburgh and Pittston, PA; Albany and E. Syracuse, NY. To operate an order-picking forklift truck you need an LO high risk work licence. This makes them suitable for navigating narrow aisles and handling long loads like timber and pipes. The very basics of forklift driving and safety that apply to all forklifts will not need to be covered as much in this training course, making it slightly quicker than novice training.</p>
<p>This is another semi-electric pallet jack truck you might want to check if you are seeking for such. This is an extremely rare type of mast configuration and reduces the lifting capacity of the truck considerably. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>
