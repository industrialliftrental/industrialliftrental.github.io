Industrial lift truck is defined in regulation as: a self-propelled vehicle used to carry, lift, stack, tier, push or pull material. Like most other lifts, a counterbalance forklift has a pair of forks in front of the vehicle.</p>
<p>It offers general, aerial, and specialty rentals to a customer base that includes construction and industrial companies; utilities; municipalities; and homeowners. Forklift trucks need to spend the maximum amount of time hard at work.

<p>Forklift Trucks have a significant and higher share across the food and beverage industry. And because body lift kits don't significantly modify the entire suspension, you're left with a high center of gravity and poor ways of dealing with death wobble. If the truck is equipped with platform or load carriage and forks, the nameplate shall also show the capacity and load center at maximum elevation of the truck load engaging means, and may show rated capacity, alternate rated capacities, and alternate capacities.</p>
