<p>These forklifts are known for what their name indicates, their ability to lift loads at a high altitude. Because of these possibilities, operators should be careful to keep the center of gravity firmly within the stability triangle. Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.</p>
<p>When you pick up the load ensure the load does not exceed the forklifts capacity. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the global Forklift Trucks Market. The Cat Lift Trucks Scholarship Program has awarded more than $130,000 in educational assistance to Houston-area students. A truck with a lift kit has a higher center of gravity than a stock truck from the factory.</p>

We supply electric and propane forklifts with the option of a narrow aisle style. The Mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets. It is not uncommon for the lift axle to operate with a much smaller tire, however, the tire is often of a greater ply rating and able to support more weight than the larger truck tires.</p>
