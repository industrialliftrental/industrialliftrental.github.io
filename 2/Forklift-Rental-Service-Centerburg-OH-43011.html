Never operate a rough terrain forklift unless you are trained and authorized. When people think of forklifts, they usually imagine the small vehicle with two forks on the front that's used for lifting pallets.

In industry sectors where robust and versatile equipment is required, two materials handling options - telehandlers and rough-terrain forklifts - stand out.</p>
<p>Standard forklifts generally measure between 4 to 7 ft wide and 8 to 10 ft long. Counterbalance forklifts are available in 4-wheel and 3-wheel configuration.
