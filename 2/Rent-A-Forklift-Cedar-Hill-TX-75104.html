<p>Operate powered industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities. Masslift Africa is the sole distributor of Mitsubishi forklifts in Southern Africa. The 8,000 lb. electric 4-wheel is used in higher capacity operations. This involves driving the pallet jack throughout the warehouse, collecting different products on the order sheet, and safely getting out of the warehouse to load the orders onto a truck or other shipping vehicle.</p>
<p>In digging around facts about a forklift rental company, some things you might consider are the company's service level agreements, the age and condition of their forklifts available for rent, as well as the questions they ask to rental enquiries. Our forklift rental fleet is regularly updated with new equipment and maintained according to manufacturer's specifications.</p>
<p>Standard forklifts generally measure between 4 to 7 ft wide and 8 to 10 ft long. Counterbalance forklifts are available in 4-wheel and 3-wheel configuration. Predicting how many lift trucks you're going to need on any given day is difficult to do. To help you adapt to the ever-changing demands of your business, we have the largest fleet of short- or long-term rental trucks available, in-stock and ready for delivery.</p>

Rough Country Suspension Lift Kits are made from quality materials and designed for an exact fit to your vehicle application.

<p>A more fuel efficient lift truck may save more than the monthly payment of the used forklift for sale. Learned a lot about safety, always look at your surroundings, the max weight limit, maintenance on the forklift, center of gravity and so on. The PTH hand pallet truck features a 5000 lb weight capacity, heavy-duty, one-piece formed forks for maximum durability, and a hydraulic system tested to more than one million cycles.</p>

<p>Furthermore, these rough terrain forklifts double as workhorses in the bush here in Australia. The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. While they can lift several times their weight, the maximum weight that they can hold is significantly lower than that of class 1 models. The catch is that you do have to test for various types of lift trucks.</p>
