<p>Quality parts for all lift trucks and all lift truck needs. Reaping those benefits, however, requires an array of skills and knowledge to operate these vehicles responsibly on site—skills and knowledge that have to be validated, either by third-party safety trainers, like myself, or by individuals who have attended training-the-trainer-type classes (more on this below), or by the vendors renting the equipment.</p>
<p>Order picker forklifts are specially designed devices that are used to optimize the speed and ease of picking stock from both sides of a warehouse aisle.

Pallet jacks can bear a lot of weight, but they also have limits that cannot be safely exceeded.</p>

Practical: Pre-Operational checks of forklift and working area, pre-operational checks of order picker and working area, negotiating hazards, shifting loads, placing loads in and out of racking, loading & unloading trucks and shut down procedures.</p>
