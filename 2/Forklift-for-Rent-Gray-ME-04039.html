From construction sites and builder's yards, to special event venues and timber forestry sites, by being so adaptable a rough terrain forklift can maximise on productivity and efficiency.</p>
<p>Electric order pickers can be operated from controls at ground level or from inside the unit so the operator can raise themselves up to the stock items.

<p>Telescopic forks - hydraulic attachments that allow the operator to operate in warehouse design for "double-deep stacking", which means that two pallet shelves are placed behind each other without any aisle between them. Attachments can be used with forklifts to make the work easier and add additional functions. SFS's Hand Pallet truck can also be used for carrying small non palletised loads with suitable improvisation to hold the load on the forks.</p>
<p>A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features. This perk makes rough terrain forklifts ideal for busy construction sites with limited space. Your rental supplier can provide you with operator training for an additional fee if you require this training for your drivers. If the bottom of this line goes outside of the stability triangle - because a load is too heavy or too high, or because the forklift is not on a level surface - it will tip over.</p>
