<p>Industrial counterbalance forklifts are the most common trucks used in indoor warehouses and stores. Angled lower backrest provides the operator with a clear view of the fork tips, which makes it easier for the operator to insert the forks into a pallet. Rough terrain forklifts typically have rugged tyres and feature heavy-duty construction. Trucks may be of the reaching or non-reaching type, equipped with tilting mast, or forks that tilt alone without tilting mast, or without any form of mast or fork tilt.</p>
<p>If you are driving a forklift for the first time, one crucial thing to remember is that forklifts are steered by the rear wheels, unlike most cars. Do not alter or eliminate any forklift parts or add any forklift parts or add any accessories such as additional counterweight or lifting attachments unless approved by the manufacturer in writing. Lifted trucks draw attention from everyone on the road and act as giant billboards at local shows, putting that paintjob high up in the sky for everyone to see.</p>
<p>It is good practice to keep the load back against the truck mast as much as possible. If you're looking specifically for Toyota forklifts, this is where you need to look. Ensure loads are stacked evenly on the forks before moving the pallet jack. ICE forklifts can handle loads of up to 15,500 pounds and are ideal for indoor operation on smooth floors. Although there are several different ways in which trucks can be lifted, most methods fall into one of two categories: body lifts and suspension lifts.</p>

<p>Our rental fleet has over 900 rentals ready for use at short notice. Lifted trucks have a negative reputation for being unsafe, but that's simply untrue. Any time the forklift's center of gravity moves outside the stability triangle, the lift will tip over. Generally, the forklift's wheels and frame are designed for a specific tire type, so check the forklift's manual before going with a different tire type than what is recommended.</p>
<p>The user should mark, on the sides of the truck, in letters at least 1½ in. high, the actual vehicle weight, the maximum load and the combined weight of the vehicle and capacity load. Because the dimensions of the machine, its weight, the counterbalance, and other elements will define the nominal load that the forklift can handle and lift. An additional set of wheels allows pallet truck to be moved sideways in addition to being the conventional forward and back directions.</p>
