<p>PA Industrial Equipment, Inc. If you are currently operating order picking forklift trucks under supervision for at least six (6) months in any setting (e.g. transport and logistic industry) and wish to obtain a plant licence, bring a letter from the employer and sample pages of the order picker Logbook you have completed over this period (this will determine the time you should spend on studies - at home and at AWFTC).</p>
<p>Order picker forklifts are specially designed devices that are used to optimize the speed and ease of picking stock from both sides of a warehouse aisle. We have taken every care to ensure that your rental lift truck has the toughness and durability to withstand the most demanding material handling operations. Pallet jacks can bear a lot of weight, but they also have limits that cannot be safely exceeded.</p>
<p>The truck should be equipped with the attachment and the test load (when required) should be representative of the capacity of the truck and attachment combination. So if you need additional materials handling equipment to keep your business up and running, we can help. If you find anything wrong with the forklift during the walk-around or seated inspection, do not operate it until it has been repaired.</p>
