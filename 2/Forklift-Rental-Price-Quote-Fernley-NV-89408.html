<p>Do you want to add some ride height to your vehicle? At Reno Forklift, we carry the top brands of forklifts to fit your needs. Methods shall be devised to train operators in the safe operation of powered industrial trucks. We are a supplier of forklifts with varying carrying capacities for different work environments. Powered industrial trucks, commonly called forklifts or lift trucks, are used in many industries, primarily to move materials.</p>
<p>Look out for any uneven surfaces that could result in technical difficulties for the stability and longevity of your reach forklift. Lifted cars have the potential to run right over smaller vehicles in the event of a high-speed accident. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident, because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.</p>
<p>A sit-down forklift fills a constant need to move equipment and materials that are too heavy for workers to move. Lift Capacity: 16000 lbs. Our AC Orderpicker trucks use fewer amps per cycle, so you'll save on batteries, chargers and downtime. Check the areas around and behind your vehicle before putting it in reverse, even if that means you need to temporarily turn the truck off, hop down out of the driver's seat and do a quick check for any children or pedestrians in the area.</p>

<p>Superior driving performance, stability and industry-leading ergonomics allow operators to work safely, productively and confidently. Shifting Supplies: Whether or not your supplies are palletized, you can shift them around with a rough terrain forklift. While the dealer insures the equipment, you'll want to make sure your company's insurance covers the operator, other people at your facility and the facility in the event of an injury or property damage when the rented forklift is in use.</p>
