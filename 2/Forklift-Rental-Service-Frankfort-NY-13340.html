<p>Operate powered industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities. LPM Forklift Sales & Service in Oklahoma and Texas offers a variety of forklifts and material handling equipment for sale, including pallet jacks, hand pallet trucks, tow tractors, walkie stackers, order pickers, narrow aisle forklifts, warehouse forklifts and heavy forklifts from Unicarriers, Linde, Manitex Lift King and Barrett Industrial Trucks.</p>
<p>Order picker forklifts are specially designed devices that are used to optimize the speed and ease of picking stock from both sides of a warehouse aisle. We have taken every care to ensure that your rental lift truck has the toughness and durability to withstand the most demanding material handling operations. Pallet jacks can bear a lot of weight, but they also have limits that cannot be safely exceeded.</p>
<p>For example, a forklift with a 10,000-pound (4,540 kg) lift capacity is limited to a maximum lift height of 20 feet (6 m) and a maximum forward reach of 8 feet (2 m) when lifting a full 10,000-pound load. In an effort to stand out but also fluently head off road and through disastrous weather conditions, we at Lewisville Autoplex Preowned suggest you try a custom lifted truck or Jeep vehicle.</p>

The price of an order picker forklift ranges from $2,500 for a small used forklift to $30,000 for a large new forklift.</p>
