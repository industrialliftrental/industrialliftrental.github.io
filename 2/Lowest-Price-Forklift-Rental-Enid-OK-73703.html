<p>The rise in lifting heights also increases the specific requirements of forklift drivers, who have to deal with greater mast oscillation and restricted vision. Once this itemized list of goods (for example, a grocery order for a local store) is collected - usually on a motorized pallet jack - the order picker gets the pallet(s) ready for loading onto a truck.</p>
