<p>JCB rough terrain forklifts are a reliable, comfortable, versatile and easy-to-use solution for any challenging rehandling environment. In a stand-up forklift, most often they require the use of a joystick which can present a learning curve to some operators.

<p>The truck should be equipped with the attachment and the test load (when required) should be representative of the capacity of the truck and attachment combination. So if you need additional materials handling equipment to keep your business up and running, we can help. If you find anything wrong with the forklift during the walk-around or seated inspection, do not operate it until it has been repaired.</p>
