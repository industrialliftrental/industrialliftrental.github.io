<p>We have access to many brands, so we will have a Forklift solution that fits your requirements. Each of these types of lift trucks have many configurations to meet the need of your specific application. Unfortunately, what are often seen running around the hard scrabble of suburbia are trucks with body lift kits. UniCarriers offers a wide range of equipment designed to fit all applications backed by the best limited warranty in the business. When you rent a lift truck, we'll be there to provide assistance with delivery, training and, if necessary, maintenance and service support.</p>

And mud tires are important if you like to hit the trail after the rain and make a mess in your lifted truck.

<h2>Osha Lift Training Hilo</h2>
<p>For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. Forklifts have a wide range in their lift capacity, ranging from as little as 3,000 pounds to as much as 35,000 pounds or more. Fortunately, for those of us who love big trucks, there are many companies out there offering big-brake upgrade kits.</p>

This is ideal if you have multiple loads in one bay that you can access from different angles, as the truck can grab loads further back.</p>
