<p>The M series is the first generation forklifts, designed by the MAXIMAL engineering team. Heli forklifts, port handling equipment, materials handling equipment, tow tractors and side loaders are all designed to keep our clients' operations flowing smoothly and efficiently with the key aim of maintaining lowest possible running costs over the long term. These options are available on flexible, competitively priced monthly payment plans ensuring that each unique customer can structure a payment plan suitable to their budgetary needs and forklift fleet requirements.</p>
<p>They're the most common type of cargo transport truck in stores, but they're also popular in warehouses and distribution centers, too. Pallet jacks come in a several types , including manual kinds, as well as electric-powered units, but the basic design is always the same: Two forks are positioned horizontal to the floor, allowing the operator to slide the jack under a pallet.</p>
<p>A forklift that cannot tolerate the amount of weight or lift that weight to the proper height is not only a waste of time and money, but it is very dangerous. A forklift is a type of material handling lift that has two prongs attached to the front of it. These prongs look like a tuning fork and assist in the lifting of objects. The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly.</p>
<h2>FEM Industrial Trucks Independence </h2>
<p>Many truck shoppers in the Lexington, Frankfort, Winchester, and Nicholasville area know they can count on Georgetown Auto Sales to give them a great selection of trucks, lifted or not, and a fair deal with honest sales. Considerations include forklift type, capacity, carriage type, and number of hydraulic functions (that power the attachment features). Using the procedure outlined for this test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which horizontal travel with unrestricted turning is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified in Graph D. Curve 1.</p>
