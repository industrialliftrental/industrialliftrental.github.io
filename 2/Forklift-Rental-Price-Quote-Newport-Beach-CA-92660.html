<p>Rough terrain forklifts are reliable, versatile and easy-to-use. While size plays an important role, forklifts carry an impressive amount of weight due to their special design. In 2019, counterbalance forklift trucks accounted for more than 60% industry share. If you drive a forklift on an incline, you must keep the load on the uphill side.
