Visit your local big-box superstore like Costco's, Sam's Club, Lowe's or Home Depot, and it's hard not to notice all those forklifts. A forklift is made out of a fork, a control unit, a motor and a counterweight.</p>
<p>Stiff competition and rising concerns regarding the efficacy of pallet trucks are expected to restrain the global market during the forecast period.

<p>Often called a tugger,” these versatile machines are most commonly used for pulling loads from Point A to Point B rather than lifting. The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight that gives the extra 500 lb. capacity to the truck. Sunbelt Rentals offers a variety of forklift equipment for any type of project.
