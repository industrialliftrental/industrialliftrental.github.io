We're New Zealand market leader in large container handling equipment, and especially in the refurbishment and sale of forklift machines.

<p>Wire guiding or rail guiding order pickers means that the lift truck can operate in an aisle as narrow as 54 inches.

<p>For high lift operations, the BT Reflex E-series features a unique tilting cab, which reduces driver strain whilst offering safer and more accurate load handling resulting in a high amount of pallet movement. But where a straight mast forklift really differs is in the maneuverability and accessibility it provides through large heavy-duty pneumatic cushion tires that enable the lift to traverse rough terrain as easily as any other equipment on the job site.</p>
<p>The truck financing specialists at Young Chevrolet can help you in making your dream of owning a lifted pickup truck a reality. Standard forklifts have little ground clearance as they are predominantly operated on solid smooth surfaces such as concrete floors. Guide rails, or electronic (or similar) guidance are suggested when lift trucks are operating in an area only used for stock pickers, side loaders, or order pickers.</p>
<p>Including heavy-duty shop presses, steel lever bars, pole jacks, reel jacks, screw jacks, and several types of ratchet jacks, we offer a full line of mechanical jacks capable of lifting up to 75 tons. Outdoor forklifts use pneumatic tires with deep treads and more ground clearance to make them easier to drive on rough terrains.
