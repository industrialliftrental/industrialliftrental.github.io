<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. Due to its smaller forklift dimensions, the pallet jack is not capable of lifting heavy weight. Two or three forklifts are usually shipped on the same load to minimize the freight charges. If you are driving aggressively in a lifted vehicle, it is a lot easier to spot the infraction and track your lifted truck down. Pallet jacks can cost less than $500 and powered hand trucks less than $3,000.</p>
<p>Options and accessories available for this type of forklifts include a rail guidance, load-facing operator controls, a retractable tether, and an auto-locking pallet clamp. Every year nearly 100 workers are killed and 20,000 are seriously injured in forklift mishaps. Designed to work specifically indoors in tight access environments like high density warehousing, standup forklifts offer a number of efficiency enhancing features that are not available on the "general use" standard sit-down forklift.</p>

<p>In addition to their smaller design, a reach forklift's cargo is lifted back within the wheelbase, enabling a smaller profile even when fully loaded.

All rough terrain forklifts have heavy-duty tires that allow them to tackle outdoor conditions. IC forklifts will generally use pneumatic tires for heavy lifting and lifting on uneven surfaces. Many models are equipped with stabilizers to ensure safe movement with shifting loads from one side of the machine to the other.</p>

We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions. When placed on the forks, the center of mass of the test weight should be located on the longitudinal centerline of the truck.</p>
<p>Forklifts also come in different sizes and models. Rough terrain forklifts are used at industrial sites where uneven surfaces can exist. The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck. If other tests or tests for trucks over 10,000 lb rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parries.</p>

<p>A lifted truck can provide you with greater ground clearance beneath your truck, even if you choose a simple lift kit, which can help you with going off-road with your pickup. Note that this classification refers to commonly-used vehicles and does not include all powered industrial trucks covered by the OSHA standard. Some of them also contain a platform on the back for the user to ride on. They are occasionally referred to as electric pallet jacks, electric pallet trucks, power jacks, and electric walkies.</p>

Allowing operators to tow palletised or non-palletised loads, our towing tractors are suitable for indoor and outdoor applications, including production lines, cross-dock logistics, airports, railway stations and ports. More elaborate lift kits not only raise the body of your truck up but can also increase the clearance of your truck's frame and let you put bigger tires on your pickup.</p>
<p>Commonly lifted vehicles include most pickups and large SUVs, especially the Ford Excursion Any vehicle designed for off-road use, however, can be lifted.

<p>Standard Hand Hydraulic High Lift Pallet Truck is fabricated using fine grade raw materials and advanced technology.
