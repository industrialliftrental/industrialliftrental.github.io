<p>Some reach trucks have a cab that tilts so that the operator can have a better view of the fork carriage, while others actually have small cameras attached to the carriage. 158 Rule: The width of one tire will be the maximum distance from the edge of the truck while on any elevated dock, platform, freight car or truck. Mid-Ohio Forklifts, Inc., is a full-service forklift dealer in North Central Ohio.</p>
<p>Tilt Mast: Changing the angle of the mast and forks helps to load items and keep them balanced. Many of the most serious forklift accidents happen when a driver drops a payload.

Common uses for these types of forklifts run the gamut, including agriculture, oil refineries, construction, manufacturing, paper mills, and pipe yards.</p>
