Built for demanding use, this pallet jack is constructed from all-welded steel components. If you leave a forklift unattended, lower the forks to the ground.

<p>Ease of operations: New forklifts will have new features that may puzzle even the most experienced operators. A warning light must automatically activate when an order picker's platform is six feet or higher and the forklift is in motion. Like the pallets themselves, pallet jacks have become a lot more standardized in North America as of late. Also, note that loads longer than 48” will extend your load center beyond the standard rating of a 24” load center.</p>
<p>Double-deep trucks are similar, but with longer forks, making them perfect for areas where multiple pallet loads are stored in each bay as they will reach right to the back of the bay.

<p>The reach forklift also features low under-carriage clearance and so we recommend that, prior to purchasing, you survey when the truck would be in operation.

A forklift is made out of a fork, a control unit, a motor and a counterweight.</p>

In honor of National Forklift Safety Day on June 12, we present our annual ranking of the 10 (actually, 11 due to a tie for 10th place) largest global manufacturers of forklifts, as ranked by revenue.</p>
