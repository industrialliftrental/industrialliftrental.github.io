The 2X Series consists of two-wheel-steer models with lift capacities from 6,000 to 12,000 pounds, available in two- and four-wheel drive.

The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. While they can lift several times their weight, the maximum weight that they can hold is significantly lower than that of class 1 models. The catch is that you do have to test for various types of lift trucks.</p>

An additional set of wheels allows pallet truck to be moved sideways in addition to being the conventional forward and back directions.</p>
