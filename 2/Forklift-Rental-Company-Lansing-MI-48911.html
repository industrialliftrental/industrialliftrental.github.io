<p>Roll Pallet Trucks are suitable for handling paper, textile, polymer, carpets and other rolls upto 2000 kgs. There's no substitute for experience, but a forklift simulator can prepare you and reduce the chances of making a mistake on the job. This type of forklift is commonly used in construction and farming. The difference is that only the mast moves and not the front tires like an articulated forklift.</p>
<p>Weight capacity is an important detail when planning your forklift rental because you do not want to pay for a rental only to find that it cannot safely lift the loads you need to handle. This hybrid design gives operators the flexibility to program the truck to run on its own or operate manually as a traditional lift truck.
