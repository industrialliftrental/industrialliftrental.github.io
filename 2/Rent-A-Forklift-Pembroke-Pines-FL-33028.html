<p>Diamond now has separate websites for Equipment and Event Rentals. Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>To help you tackle any terrain you want in your RAM Stealth, the conversions begin with a 6-inch Rocky Ridge Suspension Lift Kit. Class seven forklifts utilize large floatation type tires for use outdoors on difficult services. If the forklift's mast doesn't provide enough reach, a tower can add a few extra feet. The forklift has since become an indispensable piece of equipment in manufacturing and warehousing operation.</p>
