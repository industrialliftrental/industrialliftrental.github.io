<p>Only trained and authorized operators shall be permitted to operate a powered industrial truck. Variable-reach (or telehandler) forklifts are used to lift pallets or other objects to heights using a telescoping arm. Do not overload a lift truck.

<p>Body lifts will essentially lift the body of the truck from the frame, insert spacers on the frame, and reattach the body to the frame. One of the most popular adjustments to trucks is the lift kit - moving the entire truck higher in the air by changing out suspension parts. Pole attachments - in some locations, such as carpet warehouses, a long metal pole is used instead of forks to lift carpet rolls.</p>

High-level order pickers enable an operator to pick cases or items from 20 feet to 35 feet. Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>

Hand pallet truck is a simple device that enables floor transport of palletised goods.

The dual tires in the rear are as wide as the truck itself, and almost completely outboard of the body, so essentially it's like three trucks wide and three trucks tall coming at you.</p>
<p>The larger ground clearance allows you to install larger tires and perhaps the best part of all is that your truck will handle the same or better than it did before depending on the type of kit you install. It may be tempting to buy one of the lifted trucks for sale in Phoenix without test driving it. But don't do it.
