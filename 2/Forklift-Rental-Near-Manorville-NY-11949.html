As mentioned in the preceding section, replacing or adding an attachment may reduce (down-rate) the safe lifting capacity of the forklift truck (See also General operations, below).</p>

While it's important to go into any major mechanical change with eyes wide open, if you are truly interested in having a lifted truck, let your dreams come true.</p>
<p>Its key ability is that it can extend its forks beyond the compartment and reach into warehouse racks in a way that standard forklifts cannot.
