<p>Ziglift Material Handling is committed to your material handling needs and is open to service our essential business customers.

<p>If you are driving a forklift for the first time, one crucial thing to remember is that forklifts are steered by the rear wheels, unlike most cars. Do not alter or eliminate any forklift parts or add any forklift parts or add any accessories such as additional counterweight or lifting attachments unless approved by the manufacturer in writing. Lifted trucks draw attention from everyone on the road and act as giant billboards at local shows, putting that paintjob high up in the sky for everyone to see.</p>

<p>By raising the truck's chassis, more room is provided for large size tires and wheels. Every forklift has an identification plate that lists important information about the truck. Compact and high powered reach trucks of 1.3ton up to 2.5ton capacity offer fast response, easy operation and smooth load handling for high-density warehouse handling efficiency. How quickly the picking goes ultimately depends on the truck operator.</p>
