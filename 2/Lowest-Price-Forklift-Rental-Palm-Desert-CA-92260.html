Another place where pallet trucks are very useful and can often be found is in loading docks.</p>
<p>An electronic narrow aisle forklift with an operator platform costs roughly $25,000 to $30,000.

Any time the forklift's center of gravity moves outside the stability triangle, the lift will tip over. Generally, the forklift's wheels and frame are designed for a specific tire type, so check the forklift's manual before going with a different tire type than what is recommended.</p>

<p>For trucks with tilting forks, the forks should be horizontal or at full upward tilt, whichever is less stable. While on the subject of suspension lifts, torsion bar twisting is an inexpensive method many people use to lift their truck, which may be OK for leveling, but it is not a true lift because it merely adjusts the level at which the truck sits in its suspension travel.</p>
