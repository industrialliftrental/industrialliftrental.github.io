Industrial trucks shall be kept in a clean condition to minimize fire hazards and facilitate detection of loose or defective parts. We carry Sellick Rough Terrain forklifts at our dealerships in Fresno, Livermore, Sacramento and Salinas - including their line of full-time 4WD lift trucks Sellick has been designing and manufacturing rough terrain forklifts for nearly 50 years and, like Toyota, they are the the best at what they do.</p>
<p>We've performed many lifted truck services and we are proud of the work we've done. Keep all parts of your body inside the industrial lift truck when travelling; travel with the forks as low to the floor as possible; decrease speed around corners and sound the horn; and, travel in reverse when a load obstructs your vision. You shouldn't ever buy forklifts that haven't had a Thorough Examinations test done, and you shouldn't purchase from a forklift sales dealer who doesn't know the ins and outs of lifting equipment.</p>
<p>We are one leading and largest supplier of Hydraulic Pallet Truck in North India. Refresher training is required when there is a change in the workplace or type of truck being operated and for any operators found to be operating forklifts unsafely, those who have been involved or nearly involved in accidents or those who receive poor operation evaluations.</p>
