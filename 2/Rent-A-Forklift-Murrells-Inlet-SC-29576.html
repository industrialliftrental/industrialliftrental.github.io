<p>Whilst there are some limitations - such as the electric battery and low ground clearance - if used in the correct manner a reach forklift can be a valuable addition to a savvy warehouse's equipment. Having order picker trucks will benefit for warehouses with narrow aisles and high racking. With a narrow chassis design and 360° steering, the reach trucks in the BT Reflex N-series offer increased flexibility.</p>
<p>The higher, stronger suspension means these trucks can handle trails that are off the beaten path better than their non-lifted relatives. If the Hydraulic hand Pallet truck is not overloaded beyond the rated capacity and not pushed around on very rough surfaces then it gives good service for a very long extended period of more than 5 years.
