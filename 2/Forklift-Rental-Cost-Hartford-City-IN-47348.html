<p>Widely demanded by various industries like textile, chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and warehouse, we provideÂ ForkliftsÂ onÂ RentalÂ basis. The key market players profiled in the reach trucks market report include Combilift Material Handling Solutions Company, Crown Equipment Corporation, Doosan Corporation, Godrej and Boyce Manufacturing Company Limited, Hangcha Group Co., Ltd, Hyster-Yale Materials Handling, Inc, Jungheinrich AG, KION Group AG, Mitsubishi Logisnext Co., Ltd, and Toyota Industries Corporation.</p>
<p>Importantly, the electric pallet jack has been built with safety reverse button as well as the good quality steel. Every rental truck is prepped by a Raymond Certified Technician and quality inspected by our shop foreman to make sure that each piece of equipment is ready to work when it reaches your facility. A small handle on the tiller releases the hydraulic fluid, causing the forks to lower.</p>
<p>When lifting a load, a reach truck moves the load back within the wheelbase, meaning less of the load is protruding from the reach truck. In the event of a crash with a lifted truck, the injuries can be extensive. We only sell forklifts that we are confident to be a great value for the condition it is in. Through our connections and many resources, we are always adding units to our inventory, giving you a wide selection of makes and models to suit the needs of your operation.</p>

<p>Towing: It's easier to tow heavier loads with a lifted truck since your truck won't be as at high of risk of bottoming out. The high-lifting capability of the reach truck makes it an ideal fit for distribution centers facing a shrinking labor pool and pressure to maximize vertical storage space to accommodate inventory growth driven by e-commerce. Forklifts come with safety equipment such as an overhead guard over the operator area in front of the mast and another protecting the driver's seat.</p>
<p>These items are also inspected and fully charged before the forklift rental is delivered. Raymond stand up and sit down forklifts come equipped with exclusive features and technologies, delivering superior visibility, exceptional ergonomics, and unmatched efficiency. At Frank Kent CDJR in Ennis, Texas, we are committed to not only providing the best trucks on the road but also the highest level of customer service possible.</p>

Battery electric forklifts, powered by lead-acid batteries or, increasingly, lithium-ion batteries, include: cushion tire forklifts, scissor lifts, order pickers, stackers, reach trucks and pallet jacks.</p>
<p>Having legs for stability and carrying heavy electric batteries negates the need for a counterbalance weight and enables the reach forklift to maintain a more compact body. Pallet jacks are cheap, small in size, and good for small loads. Renting a forklift affects your bottom line a lot less than purchasing one, at least over a short period of time. Our nationwide dealer network has a broad range of lift truck models available for immediate rental.</p>
