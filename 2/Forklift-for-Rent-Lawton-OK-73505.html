Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that a line connecting the center of either load wheel tire (or outermost tire where multiple tires are used) and the projection perpendicular to the platform of the point of intersection of the longitudinal centerline of the truck and the centerline of the steering wheels is parallel to the axis of tilting of the platform.</p>
<p>Lift and tow heavy or extremely large loads efficiently and safely in rough terrain environments with power and precision. Lift Capacity: 6000 lbs. The pallet jack drop lever is often a small lever in the middle of the rounded handle, on the vertical stem of the manual machine. Drivers can expect a wide-range of truck body styles and capabilities in addition to automakers at Gibson Truck World.</p>
<p>Service intervals of 1,000 operating hours mean that trucks operate reliably. Whether you're using the truck to commute to work every day or planning to carve your own path offroad, choosing the right lift kit is a crucial decision.

Do not steer pallet jacks onto uneven surfaces and avoid steep inclines. A pallet jack scale or a pallet truck scale can typically lift 120 mm.
