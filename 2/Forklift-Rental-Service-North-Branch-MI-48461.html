<p>We understand that determining the best used forklift for your specific needs is difficult. Key parts like your brakes, suspension system, and tires will need to be refreshed more often than if you drove a non-lifted truck. This is ideal if you have multiple loads in one bay that you can access from different angles, as the truck can grab loads further back.</p>
