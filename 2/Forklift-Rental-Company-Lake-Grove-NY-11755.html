At Cat® Lift Trucks we design and build counterbalance forklift trucks for every application. It is rumored that electric forklifts are maintenance free due to less moving parts and their cleaner environments. Additionally Pengate rentals offer the following advantages: low rates (which include batteries and chargers); rental rates may be expensible for tax purposes; maintenance service by our Raymond Certified Technicians at no added charge; the ability to opt into a rent-to-own program.</p>
<p>We've performed many lifted truck services and we are proud of the work we've done. Keep all parts of your body inside the industrial lift truck when travelling; travel with the forks as low to the floor as possible; decrease speed around corners and sound the horn; and, travel in reverse when a load obstructs your vision. You shouldn't ever buy forklifts that haven't had a Thorough Examinations test done, and you shouldn't purchase from a forklift sales dealer who doesn't know the ins and outs of lifting equipment.</p>

You'll need to raise your truck a lot and put on improved suspension components (shocks, springs, etc.) if you're thinking of really going off-road. Also, it is very important that the driver of the lifted vehicle be aware of other vehicles around him or her when switching lanes, backing out, and entering small city roads.</p>

Lifted cars can cost hundreds to thousands of dollars more So, if you are going to buy one, it's only fair that you test it out first.</p>
