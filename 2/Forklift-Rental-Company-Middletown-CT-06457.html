<p>Remember, the operator is responsible for the safe operation of the forklift. Keep in mind that the higher you are lifting a load the lower the capacity will become.

Our Forklift Order Picker Cages assist in warehouse applications where goods are packed and picked at elevated heights.</p>

<p>Sometimes using a forklift for your pallet moving operation is like taking a bazooka to a knife fight. Many aftermarket lift kits provide CV spacers to move the stock axle outward, effectively lengthening it, but spacers aren't necessarily the best answer for the long haul. A properly loaded lift truck does not exceed the rated capacity of the truck as listed on the trucks data plate.</p>
<p>We understand that determining the best used forklift for your specific needs is difficult. Key parts like your brakes, suspension system, and tires will need to be refreshed more often than if you drove a non-lifted truck. This is ideal if you have multiple loads in one bay that you can access from different angles, as the truck can grab loads further back.</p>
