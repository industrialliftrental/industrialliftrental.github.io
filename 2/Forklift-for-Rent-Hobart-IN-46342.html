<p>Compared to the internal combustion systems, the performance of AC trucks in parameters such as load-lift ability, ability to negotiate a ramp, acceleration, speed control on-ramps, and braking are gaining attraction of the industries. Because there is no load, the center of gravity is nearly in the center of the forklift's counterbalance.

Though many lift kits include step-by-step directions for do-it-yourself installations, it's usually best to enlist the services of a professional mechanic at a trusted dealership to lift your truck.</p>
