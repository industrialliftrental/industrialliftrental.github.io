Using the procedure outlined for the test, an empty truck with the forks elevated to any height up to the maximum height at which horizontal travel is permitted, and for the travel speed allowable at that height, should not overturn when the test platform, and for the travel speed allowable at that height, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified by Graph D, Curve 1, for unrestricted turning and by Graph D, Curve 2, for straight forward and reverse travel, travel, no turning ± 10 degrees.</p>
<p>Stay up to date by perusing manuals, guides, and literature put out by the manufacturers of the forklifts as well as the industry leaders. Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension.
