<p>Operate powered industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities. Masslift Africa is the sole distributor of Mitsubishi forklifts in Southern Africa. The 8,000 lb. electric 4-wheel is used in higher capacity operations. This involves driving the pallet jack throughout the warehouse, collecting different products on the order sheet, and safely getting out of the warehouse to load the orders onto a truck or other shipping vehicle.</p>
<p>It will allow you to efficiently pick goods on a pallet and quickly move from rack to rack as well as give you the ability to drive the lifter into a container in order to unload goods. Each type of powered industrial truck presents different operating hazards. Pallet jacks are manufactured in a range of sizes, power options and lift capacity. We offer forklift sales and rentals that include everything from pallet stackers to reach trucks.</p>
<p>With most models, you'll get two forks that allow your crew to pick up and lift all kinds of pallets. The main things you will need to consider would be the cost of purchasing forklifts to rent out, maintaining the forklifts between rentals, and also having qualified forklift repair-persons capable of doing repairs on-site.

<p>WIU Physical Plant will document operator training and an evaluation of the operator's performance while using the forklift. Always wear gloves when handling pallets. That's why Linde develops entirely individual order pickers based on a modular system, featuring, for example, different mast heights, working platforms, chassis sizes, and operating and control concepts.</p>
<p>At the same time, reach trucks offer very high acceleration as well as impressive lift and reach speeds, which in turn ensures excellent throughput performance. This can actually also be cost effective in the long run, as a long-term loan of a forklift can eventually cost you more than the fee to purchase it outright. Hand Pallet Truck with Scale is an excellent economic solution for all weighing requirements in busy warehouse environments , which allows you to weigh cargo where you want and when you want.</p>
