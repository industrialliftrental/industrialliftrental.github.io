We offer forklift sales and rentals that include everything from pallet stackers to reach trucks.</p>
<p>With most models, you'll get two forks that allow your crew to pick up and lift all kinds of pallets.

That's why Linde develops entirely individual order pickers based on a modular system, featuring, for example, different mast heights, working platforms, chassis sizes, and operating and control concepts.</p>
<p>At the same time, reach trucks offer very high acceleration as well as impressive lift and reach speeds, which in turn ensures excellent throughput performance.
