On the other hand, there are order picker trucks that have forks that are fixed in front of the platform and thus cannot be moved.</p>
<p>In digging around facts about a forklift rental company, some things you might consider are the company's service level agreements, the age and condition of their forklifts available for rent, as well as the questions they ask to rental enquiries. Our forklift rental fleet is regularly updated with new equipment and maintained according to manufacturer's specifications.</p>
