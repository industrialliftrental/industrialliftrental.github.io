<p>The desire to own the biggest, baddest, shiniest forklift fresh off the assembly line is understandable. Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that a line connecting the center of either load wheel tire (or outermost tire where multiple tires are used) and the projection perpendicular to the platform of the point of intersection of the longitudinal centerline of the truck and the centerline of the steering wheels is parallel to the axis of tilting of the platform.</p>

Repair or replacement - if your forklift breaks down at any time, we will repair or replace it normally within 2 to 3 hours, depending on your location.</p>

Most industrial counterbalance forklift trucks have internal combustion cushion tires which are perfect for indoor use.</p>
