The handle shall be mounted in such manner that the operator will steer with his left hand when facing the load end of the truck. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift.

The order picker is not suited for tasks such as: unit load picking, or right angle stacking, and transportation for long travel distances. Our entire business is built around lifting 4×4 trucks, putting a new lift kit, wheel and tire on them and making them ready for the next customer.</p>
