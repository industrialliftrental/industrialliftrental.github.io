<p>Our forklifts are widely demanded by various industries like textile, warehouse, chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, aviation, glass, ceremics, construction, beverages, automobile OEM & its Ancillary unit. Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
<p>The warehouse forklift has two subtypes: the side loader and the counterbalance forklift. In daily use, your drivers will enjoy the many benefits offered by our electric forklifts, including extra seat comfort, a perfect all-round view and comprehensive assistance systems to protect the operator, load and warehouse.
