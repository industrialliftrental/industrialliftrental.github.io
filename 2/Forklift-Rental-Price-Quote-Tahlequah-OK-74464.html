Many of these Custom and Lifted trucks are featured in some of the highest trim levels and many come standard with I6, V6 or V8 engines, meaning you just might get a lot more powertrain, torque and convenient technological amenities for your money; such features include front dual-zone climate control, front and rear parking sensors, adjustable pedals, a built-in navigation system or a HomeLink Universal Garage Door Opener.</p>

It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable.</p>
