In an electric forklift the large battery may serve as part of the counterweight.</p>
<p>Our trio of RTFLs have a range of operating weights, lift capacities and dimensions to suit, and they're all powered by our world-renowned efficient EcoMax engine. Included in this class are lift trucks with 3 or 4 wheels and either cushion (solid) or pneumatic (air filled) tires. If the upright malfunctions in any way or becomes stuck in a raised position, you should operate the lift control to eliminate slack chains and not attempt to reach into the upright to free the hang-up.</p>
<p>This additional clearance requires installing larger tires and in order to do that, you need to get everything up off the ground more.
