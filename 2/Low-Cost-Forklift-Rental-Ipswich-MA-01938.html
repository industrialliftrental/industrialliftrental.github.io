<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Check to make sure that the pallet jack is not on the cross wood of the skid, front wheels must be on the floor. In a forklift the operator sits on a seat with a seatbelt, a steering wheel and hand controls to move the lifting mechanisms. We offer certification on the Counterbalance Forklift from the following awarding bodies: RTITB, NPORS, CPCS, LANTRA. Our OSHA experts and training specialists are standing by to help you with all your counterbalance forklift training needs.</p>

The traditional model of the forklift stability triangle is useful, but it leaves out one important thing: three-dimensional space.

<p>For pallet jacks that can weigh for dual efficiency, contact METTLER TOLEDO. We recommend this pallet jack due to its' heavy duty structure and its affordability. They also build gas, diesel, and electric engines for their forklifts. They have dual forks at the front of the truck and a weight in the back to offset the weight of the load in the front. It is the highest capacity stockpicker in the line, handling heavy palletized loads at heights up to 366 inches.</p>
