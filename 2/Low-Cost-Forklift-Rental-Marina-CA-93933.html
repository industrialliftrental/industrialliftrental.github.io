Toyota Forklifts has introduced three new order pickers. Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers. What you need to do: Take a practical test where the forklift is driven around a suitable course and the operator will be required to move and stack various loads, the test will also include one to one verbal questioning.</p>

Renting a forklift requires almost as much forethought as buying one. The BT Levio R-series powered pallet truck range are perfect for long-distance handling of multiple loads.
