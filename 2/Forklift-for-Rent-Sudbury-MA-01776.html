<p>PA Industrial Equipment, Inc. HIGH-LIFT PLATFORM TRUCK: A self-loading truck equipped with a load platform, intended primarily for transporting and tiering loaded skid platforms (Fig. OSHA General Industry Standard 1910.178()(1) Only stable or safely arranged loads shall be handled. Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation to avoid tipovers and accidents.</p>
<p>Displays showing the load weight and lift height provide the driver with the necessary information to transport and stack loads safely while still ensuring fast work cycles. Best of all, these GMC lifted truck modifications do not voice the warranty. The load capacity of the forklift will restrict the load capacity of the order picker cages. A wide variety of industrial reach trucks options are available to you, such as new.</p>
<p>The main safety concern pertains to the lifted vehicle's bumper height from the ground. In addition to this, reach forklifts can be fitted with a camera that shows the driver what is happening above their head on a video screen. But palletisation really enhances the material handling efficiency and throughput. Rough terrain forklifts are larger, stronger and more durable and hence they are pricey than the average forklift.</p>

The TSE100 model is for conventional towing and the TSE100W is designed to dock with individual load carriers for efficient order picking and can be used with, for example a trolley with a built-in ladder for picking on second level.

Let our sales representatives know exactly what the application is and we will help you determine what type of forklifts are best. You can always combine the best of both worlds, however, by choosing a great off-road focused Chevy truck, and then getting it lifted for even better clearance and larger tires.</p>
