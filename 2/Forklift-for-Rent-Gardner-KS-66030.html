<p>While a side loader can measure less than five feet wide to fit into narrow spaces, a counterbalance forklift may need up to 13 feet to easily turn and maneuver through aisles. Your 4×4 truck can be your ticket to off-road adventures, your daily driver around town, your hauling and towing machine, or your work truck. If everything looks sound, place the pallet jack in a designed storage area, with the handle locked in a raised position.</p>
<p>When renting forklifts these points will help ensure your rental experience is safe, cost effective, and gets the job done. The durability of the PTH Series is enhanced by a reinforced lower handle, strong C-channel forks made of thick steel, cross braces and steel forgings on lift link arms and box-style pushrods.

Capacity requirements can arise without notice, so a forklift rental can help an operation stay nimble and responsive to changing business conditions.
