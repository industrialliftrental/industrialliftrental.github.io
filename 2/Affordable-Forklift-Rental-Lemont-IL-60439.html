<p>Order picking trucks have a working platform that helps the operator to control the lift. Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
<p>Reach trucks aren't meant for moving loads long distances. If you're unable to find a pre-made lifted truck in your area, or if these vehicles are too expensive for your budget, you may have more luck modifying a truck yourself. The Forklift Order Picker Cages have durable wire mesh backs and side panels and are to be used in conjunction with a body harness (for working at heights).</p>

However, to maximize the benefits you can gain from a short-term forklift rental, you need to understand lift truck rental agreements and how they align to the needs of your specific business.
