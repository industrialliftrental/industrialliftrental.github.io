<p>Forklift is a small industrial vehicle, having a power operated forked platform attached at the front that can be raised and lowered for insertion under a cargo to lift or move it. Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities. Our wide range includes Standard Forks (540 mm), narrow forks (450 mm) wide forks (685 mm) super wide forks (800 mm, 1000 mm) short, long & super long forks (900 mm, 1150 mm, 1220 mm, 1500 mm, 1800 mm, 2500 mm) in minimum fork heights of 36 mm, 51 mm, 75 mm & 85 mm. We offer finish such as painted, powder coated, galvanised, pallet trucks of special materials such as stainless steel.</p>
<p>We've performed many lifted truck services and we are proud of the work we've done. Keep all parts of your body inside the industrial lift truck when travelling; travel with the forks as low to the floor as possible; decrease speed around corners and sound the horn; and, travel in reverse when a load obstructs your vision. You shouldn't ever buy forklifts that haven't had a Thorough Examinations test done, and you shouldn't purchase from a forklift sales dealer who doesn't know the ins and outs of lifting equipment.</p>
<p>Some SP Series models feature a 36-volt battery, which enables common batteries and chargers to be used across your lift truck fleet to optimise battery performance and shift life. Order pickers work best in warehouses that operate for library archival storage, retail applications and furniture picking. Ideal for narrow aisles the side stance truck has the forks located on the side of the cab affording excellent visibility for the operator and minimizing maneuvering.</p>
<h2>Truck And Lorry Mounted Forklift Bensalem </h2>

<p>In addition to their smaller design, a reach forklift's cargo is lifted back within the wheelbase, enabling a smaller profile even when fully loaded. Forklifts are rated for loads at a specified maximum weight and a specified forward center of gravity This information is located on a nameplate provided by the manufacturer, and loads must not exceed these specifications.</p>
