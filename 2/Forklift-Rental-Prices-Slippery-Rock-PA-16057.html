Besides the most experienced order picker training, we also offer other top quality workplace training services for businesses and individuals including forklift training , RF scanning courses , onsite training and refresher courses for businesses who want to up-skill or refresh their order picker operator's practical skills.</p>

The handle shall be mounted in such manner that the operator will steer with his left hand when facing the load end of the truck. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift.
