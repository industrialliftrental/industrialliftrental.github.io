<p>This is achieved by two outer legs which distribute the load weight and prevent the forklift from tipping. OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years.
