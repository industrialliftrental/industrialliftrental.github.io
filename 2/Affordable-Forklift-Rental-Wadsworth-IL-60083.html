<p>BJ's Rentals, Inc. Rapid development of vertical tower forklifts for industrial use was adapted to rough terrain forklifts as well. First, the fact that your forklift is rented means that you aren't solely responsible for its upkeep and maintenance. This type of truck, unlike Articulated Narrow Aisle Trucks, requires a high standard of floor flatness. A part of the warranty, we include maintenance kits with the machines, so you can forget about additional costs when you receive your Bomaq forklift.</p>
