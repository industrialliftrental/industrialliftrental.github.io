<p>Diamond now has separate websites for Equipment and Event Rentals. Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>Rough Terrain Forklifts : Use: Primarily used outdoors where terrain may be rough. Class III type segment is expected to be the leading segment in Forklift Trucks Market during the forecast period.

The pallet jack also features a durable sealed pump with overload safety system.</p>
