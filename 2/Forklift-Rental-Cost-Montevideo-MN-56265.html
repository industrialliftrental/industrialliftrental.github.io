<p>Picking out the right lift kit height means you'll need to know a little bit more about how certain lift heights will affect your vehicle's performance and what they are generally used for. Load Capacity or Rated Operating Capacity refers to how much weight the pallet jack can safely lift. Motorized hand trucks must enter elevator or other confined areas with load end forward.</p>

<p>The order picker operator stands on a platform and moves up with the mast, unlike most lift trucks.

Affordability - Rental forklift is highly affordable; you can rent a high-capacity forklift at a very reasonable cost.
