The JBT-intelligent robotic reach truck uses a combination of sensors and 3D cameras for maximum precision and effectiveness at higher-level storage locations, capable of exceeding the productivity of operator-driven trucks. Diesel forklifts are strongly recommended if the forklift will be used for heavy lifting or outdoors.</p>
