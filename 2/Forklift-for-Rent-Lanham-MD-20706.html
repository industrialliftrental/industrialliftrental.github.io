<p>This is where Freight Buddy comes in. With decades of experience in the shipping industry and warehouses in general, we know a thing or two about what to look for when it comes to buying a quality pallet jack. As the forklift begins to tip, it will move slowly, tricking the operator into believing there is time to jump.

The Toyota Core Electric Forklift is a popular unit due to its utility. It is also backed with priority support from our nationwide team of field service forklift technicians. We are supplier, importer and exporter of 3- Wheel Electric Forklift Trucks (RCF).</p>
<p>We understand that determining the best used forklift for your specific needs is difficult. Key parts like your brakes, suspension system, and tires will need to be refreshed more often than if you drove a non-lifted truck. This is ideal if you have multiple loads in one bay that you can access from different angles, as the truck can grab loads further back.</p>
