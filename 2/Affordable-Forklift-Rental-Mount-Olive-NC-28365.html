<p>With so many different types of forklifts , your workplace efficiency and productivity depends on selecting the right equipment for your needs. To use a forklift on a public road, the operator must obtain a forklift (F) endorsement on their driver licence Operators with a class 1 (car) licence and an F endorsement may only operate forklifts up to 18,000 kg gross laden weight, while those holding a class 2 (medium rigid) licence and an F endorsement can operate a forklift of any gross laden weight.</p>
<p>The term fork lift refers to a variety of motor-powered trucks equipped with lifting forks that are used for loading, unloading, and organizing materials that are stacked on pallets or designed for lifting with forks. Category includes box trucks, maintenance trucks, forklifts, tow trucks, flatbed trucks, electric carts. Rough terrain forklifts, often known as telehandlers, are engineered for operation on some of the most extreme terrain and climatic conditions.</p>

Built for demanding use, this pallet jack is constructed from all-welded steel components. If you leave a forklift unattended, lower the forks to the ground. Do not lift the heaviest load to the maximum lift or stacking height.</p>

<p>Rentals are a repeat business - your customers only rent your equipment for a period of time, so if they need it again in the future they have to rent again.
