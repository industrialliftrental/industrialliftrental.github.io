<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height for the limit of travel speed, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified by Graph C about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
<p>Raymond's ACR System (advanced AC motor control system) delivers powerful AC drive and lift that reduces downtime and increases warehouse productivity enabling faster, smoother operation while increasing operator confidence and lowering total cost of ownership. I'd also like to say that I drive a truck, 2010 F-150 Platinum everyday to and from work and love trucks very dearly as I grew up driving them in Iowa.</p>
<p>These trucks were hand operated, could only lift the goods 5 to 7 centimeters off the ground, and since they required a lot of manual effort from the operator, could only move the goods about a single meter laterally. Forklift Sales Botswana started over 15 years ago, when we took on the TOYOTA Forklift Dealer, and since then we have a current, estimated 80% share of the Botswana Forklift Market.</p>

The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load-center dimension and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck.
