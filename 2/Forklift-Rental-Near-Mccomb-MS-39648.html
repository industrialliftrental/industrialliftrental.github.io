<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? For tests requiring an elevated load, it may be more convenient to simulate a load by hanging the test load from a framework supported by the forks in the manner described in item 3. This point of suspension, of course, must be on centerline of truck and at a height above forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>
<p>Contact us if you have more forklift accident statistics to contribute to this page. The traditional model of the forklift stability triangle is useful, but it leaves out one important thing: three-dimensional space.
