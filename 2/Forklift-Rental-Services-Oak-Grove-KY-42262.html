<h3>Largest Forklift Manufacturers Oak Grove KY</h3>
<p>When you rent a forklift from Gregory Poole Lift Systems, you get the adaptability you need from your forklift fleet, without a huge impact on your bottom line. In most instances, renting a forklift makes more sense than buying one. Most counterbalanced forklifts have a three-point suspension system, meaning that the truck is supported at the two front wheels and the center of the steer axle.</p>
<p>This is where Freight Buddy comes in. With decades of experience in the shipping industry and warehouses in general, we know a thing or two about what to look for when it comes to buying a quality pallet jack. As the forklift begins to tip, it will move slowly, tricking the operator into believing there is time to jump. To avoid accidents, maintain a safe distance from other forklifts and pedestrians when the truck is elevated.</p>
<p>Heavy duty design: 4mm steel plate fork frame and largerd lift piston ensure the truck to reach rated capacity. Four fixed-fork order pickers are ideally suited for picking bulky, oversized items or where extended platforms and industrial carts are used in place of pallets. If you need the forklift to operate under a fixed height structure, such as a container door then you should also consider the collapsed height of the mast.</p>
