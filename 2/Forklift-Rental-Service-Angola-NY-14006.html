HIGH-LIFT PLATFORM TRUCK: A self-loading truck equipped with a load platform, intended primarily for transporting and tiering loaded skid platforms (Fig. OSHA General Industry Standard 1910.178()(1) Only stable or safely arranged loads shall be handled. Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation to avoid tipovers and accidents.</p>
<p>Look out for any uneven surfaces that could result in technical difficulties for the stability and longevity of your reach forklift. Lifted cars have the potential to run right over smaller vehicles in the event of a high-speed accident. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident, because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.</p>
<p>Mariotti, maker of some of the smallest forklifts on the market, has options that are ideal for tight spaces and unusual applications (need to get through a small doorway or into an elevator?) or weight-sensitive work spaces like an old factory.
