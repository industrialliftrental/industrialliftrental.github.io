It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable.</p>
<p>These trucks were hand operated, could only lift the goods 5 to 7 centimeters off the ground, and since they required a lot of manual effort from the operator, could only move the goods about a single meter laterally. Forklift Sales Botswana started over 15 years ago, when we took on the TOYOTA Forklift Dealer, and since then we have a current, estimated 80% share of the Botswana Forklift Market.</p>
