<p>Lift Code 4: Three Wheel Electric Trucks, Sit Down. 3. 3 Acknowledgment OSHA's Office of Training and Education wishes to acknowledge the following for contributing some of the graphics used in this presentation:  Caterpillar Lift Trucks  Mason Contractors Association of America  Industrial Truck Association  State of Utah Labor Commission - Occupational Safety & Health Division  Steamship Trade Association of Baltimore  Taylor Machine Works, Inc.</p>
<p>Many lifted truck stores put lifts on high mile trucks, and this can lead to a poor ride and other issues that are associated with lifted vehicles. As a result of the flip-up driver platform and Click-2-Creep, these powered pallet trucks are ideal for working in confined areas and for loading and unloading lorries. The heavy-duty models that can lift big loads have an even larger fork shaft and double wheels at the front.</p>
<p>These mobile, self-loading trucks are power-propelled to carry, push, pull, lift, stack or tier material. Reach trucks are used most in warehouses for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights. For example, additional viewing windows have been integrated for added safety and the control panel has been designed to be even more user-friendly.</p>
