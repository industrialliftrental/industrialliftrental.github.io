These solid machines have proven their reliability and strength in heavy applications around the world, particularly in aluminium, steel, block and container handling applications, whether new or used forklifts.

<h3>Forklift Handling Midvale UT</h3>

Designed to work in narrow aisles, the electric reach stacker can tilt both forwards and backwards for safer load handling. A body lift does not increase the clearance by a huge amount, other than by allowing for bigger tires that can help raise the underside.</p>

<p>Remember, the operator is responsible for the safe operation of the forklift. Keep in mind that the higher you are lifting a load the lower the capacity will become.

Our Forklift Order Picker Cages assist in warehouse applications where goods are packed and picked at elevated heights.</p>
