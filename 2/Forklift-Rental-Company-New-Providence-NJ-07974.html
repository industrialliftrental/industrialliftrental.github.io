<p>Electric forklift not holding charge? Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.). The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>
<p>The Herc Rental fleet is worth more than $3 billion. In other words if you are unloading pallets from racking and your top beam is at 144” you will need a lift truck that has a maximum fork height of a few inches higher to ensure you will be able to lift pallet above the rack and then remove the pallet from the racks.

<p>With most models, you'll get two forks that allow your crew to pick up and lift all kinds of pallets.

Almost exclusively found on farms, tractor forklifts are simply a tractor with a forklift mast mounted on either the front or the back of the tractor.</p>
