<p>This course is designed to provide experienced operators with relevant knowledge and understanding of practical use of the Industrial Counterbalance Forklift. In the Guru, when referring to overall width for class 2 & 3 trucks, overall width refers to the width of the power unit, not the outriggers. Specifically, adding such a large lift kit or monstrous wheels and tires can make daily driving around the city a real chore. No matter what size or capacity you need, you can find a rough terrain forklift for the job.</p>
<p>We've performed many lifted truck services and we are proud of the work we've done. Keep all parts of your body inside the industrial lift truck when travelling; travel with the forks as low to the floor as possible; decrease speed around corners and sound the horn; and, travel in reverse when a load obstructs your vision. You shouldn't ever buy forklifts that haven't had a Thorough Examinations test done, and you shouldn't purchase from a forklift sales dealer who doesn't know the ins and outs of lifting equipment.</p>
<p>When lifting a load, a reach truck moves the load back within the wheelbase, meaning less of the load is protruding from the reach truck. In the event of a crash with a lifted truck, the injuries can be extensive. We only sell forklifts that we are confident to be a great value for the condition it is in. Through our connections and many resources, we are always adding units to our inventory, giving you a wide selection of makes and models to suit the needs of your operation.</p>

You can also hire our trucks for a longer fixed-term rental period, for up to 7 years. These features ensure that the machines can move safely on loose ground, rocky areas, and uneven terrain.

<p>Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.
