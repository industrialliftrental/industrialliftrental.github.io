<p>Ease of operations: New forklifts will have new features that may puzzle even the most experienced operators. A warning light must automatically activate when an order picker's platform is six feet or higher and the forklift is in motion. Like the pallets themselves, pallet jacks have become a lot more standardized in North America as of late. Also, note that loads longer than 48” will extend your load center beyond the standard rating of a 24” load center.</p>
<p>This is another semi-electric pallet jack truck you might want to check if you are seeking for such. This is an extremely rare type of mast configuration and reduces the lifting capacity of the truck considerably. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>

<p>Furthermore, these rough terrain forklifts double as workhorses in the bush here in Australia. The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. While they can lift several times their weight, the maximum weight that they can hold is significantly lower than that of class 1 models. The catch is that you do have to test for various types of lift trucks.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with standard lift trucks, straight mast forklifts are essentially a cross between a forklift and an RTV. However, to maximize the benefits you can gain from a short-term forklift rental, you need to understand lift truck rental agreements and how they align to the needs of your specific business. The lifted suspension helps your truck better handle the rough nature of going off-road, plus the higher ground clearance means you won't bottom out as often.</p>
