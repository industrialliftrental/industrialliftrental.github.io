<h2>Used Pallet Jack Wallace</h2>
<p>This is an efficient way of picking less than pallet load shipments, and is popular for use in large distribution centers. Eliminate your parts and service departments - If you currently own your fleet and maintain it you need mechanics, tools and parts.

<p>My "beater" 4WD has a 3" lift kit that gives it about a 10" minimum ground clearance-more than enough clearance to handle some quite nasty trails-but I actually use my 4WD for both work and pleasure in areas where such capability is a necessity. This is expected to drive the demand for warehousing, which in turn, will drive the global Pallet Trucks market in the coming years.</p>

The wheels and tires are key components that set rough terrain forklifts apart from standard models.</p>
