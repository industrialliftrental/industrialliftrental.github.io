Masslift Africa is the sole distributor of Mitsubishi forklifts in Southern Africa. The 8,000 lb. electric 4-wheel is used in higher capacity operations. This involves driving the pallet jack throughout the warehouse, collecting different products on the order sheet, and safely getting out of the warehouse to load the orders onto a truck or other shipping vehicle.</p>
<p>Many lifted truck stores put lifts on high mile trucks, and this can lead to a poor ride and other issues that are associated with lifted vehicles. As a result of the flip-up driver platform and Click-2-Creep, these powered pallet trucks are ideal for working in confined areas and for loading and unloading lorries. The heavy-duty models that can lift big loads have an even larger fork shaft and double wheels at the front.</p>
<p>This is achieved by two outer legs which distribute the load weight and prevent the forklift from tipping. OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years. Technology makes today's RT forklifts safe, comfortable, and environmentally friendly.</p>
