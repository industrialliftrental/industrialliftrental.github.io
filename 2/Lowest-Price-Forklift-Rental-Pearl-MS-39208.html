<p>Industrial counterbalance forklifts are the most common trucks used in indoor warehouses and stores. Angled lower backrest provides the operator with a clear view of the fork tips, which makes it easier for the operator to insert the forks into a pallet. Rough terrain forklifts typically have rugged tyres and feature heavy-duty construction. Trucks may be of the reaching or non-reaching type, equipped with tilting mast, or forks that tilt alone without tilting mast, or without any form of mast or fork tilt.</p>
<p>Rough Terrain lift trucks, which are Class 7 forklifts, require separate operator training. Plus, their 8,000+ rental yards means there's probably one near you already. There are various hand pallet trucks such as electric hand pallet trucks and hydraulic hand pallet trucks to suit your warehouse needs.
