<p>Now I have seen a few TASTEFUL trucks lifted, the person who posted the lifted Dodge Ram was nice. The Industrial Duty Pallet Jack is great for small spaces, and handles easily. Look for a forklift provider whose rental fleet is new, clean and well-maintained; one who assures you that, if there should ever be a problem, they are staffed with certified field technicians to conduct emergency on-site repairs.</p>
<p>This has been very effective in training my employees in forklift safety and operation. Toyota's 6BWC20 is ideal for 4,000 lb loads, while Jungeinrich's EMC 110 is suited for narrow aisles.
