Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.</p>

Included in this class are lift trucks with 3 or 4 wheels and either cushion (solid) or pneumatic (air filled) tires. If the upright malfunctions in any way or becomes stuck in a raised position, you should operate the lift control to eliminate slack chains and not attempt to reach into the upright to free the hang-up.</p>
<p>The larger ground clearance allows you to install larger tires and perhaps the best part of all is that your truck will handle the same or better than it did before depending on the type of kit you install. It may be tempting to buy one of the lifted trucks for sale in Phoenix without test driving it. But don't do it.
