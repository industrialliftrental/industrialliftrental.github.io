According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the counterbalance load distribution are involved in falling load accidents more frequently than other types of powered industrial trucks.</p>

After learning about each of these appliances and their uses, it is essential to sit down and reflect. Operators should be trained to operate the type of trucks they work on. They should also know the potential risks for each model.</p>
<p>Most forklift rentals give general training for handling the rented equipment. In addition to this, the industrial counterbalance forklift offers straightforward operation. A rental forklift is often the best option when the need for the lift truck is mostly seasonal. Providing a standup platform rather than a seat allows for the reach truck's shortened length giving it its "tight access" capability.</p>
