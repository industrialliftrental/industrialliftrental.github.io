<p>With so many different types of forklifts , your workplace efficiency and productivity depends on selecting the right equipment for your needs. To use a forklift on a public road, the operator must obtain a forklift (F) endorsement on their driver licence Operators with a class 1 (car) licence and an F endorsement may only operate forklifts up to 18,000 kg gross laden weight, while those holding a class 2 (medium rigid) licence and an F endorsement can operate a forklift of any gross laden weight.</p>
<p>While moving palletized loads is fastest and easiest, these machines can load and unload a variety of objects. Our Rental Purchase Option (RPO) provides customers with an opportunity to acquire equipment by building equity over the rental period. Growing industrialization is anticipated to drive the demand for pallet trucks, especially from non-traditional industries in growing economies in Asia Pacific.</p>
<p>When lifting a load, a reach truck moves the load back within the wheelbase, meaning less of the load is protruding from the reach truck. In the event of a crash with a lifted truck, the injuries can be extensive. We only sell forklifts that we are confident to be a great value for the condition it is in. Through our connections and many resources, we are always adding units to our inventory, giving you a wide selection of makes and models to suit the needs of your operation.</p>

The controls of a forklift consist of a series of levers which open and close valves on the hydraulic cylinders.</p>
