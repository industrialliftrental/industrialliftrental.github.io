<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height for the limit of travel speed, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified by Graph C about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
<p>Note: In order to receive your C4 Forklift Operation Certification, you must take and pass a performance evaluation given by your employer at your job site. It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable.</p>
<p>Before choosing the right forklift, you need to identify your needs and the forklift's purpose. Offered array of rental services is rendered as per quality norms. If you're interested in purchasing a lifted or modified truck, you may want to begin by conducting a thorough search of the dealerships and mechanics in your area.

<p>Mast forklifts are designed for vertical applications, although some models have the ability to tilt forward or back. Stand-up trucks are the most common type.
