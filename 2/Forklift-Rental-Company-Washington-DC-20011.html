<p>This course must be completed for forklift operators to be in compliance of the Ontario MOL regulations. The first thing when it comes to owning lifted trucks is to understand how you'd like to spend your money. If you are planning to go for one of the above kinds of pallet trucks, CUMI LIFT has a range of it, you can pick the one that most suits your needs. Also, the higher you go with a twist, the less down travel you will have, causing quirky handling, such as skipping across the road imperfections, rather that soaking them up. On 4x4 vehicles, this also causes an issue because you could over-extend a CV axle joint on a truck that has excessive compression, but limited droop.</p>
