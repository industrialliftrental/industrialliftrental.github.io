<p>Forklift roll-overs represent around 25% of forklift-related deaths. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). Types of jobs where you might encounter rough terrain forklifts are lumber yards, builders, brick yards, land movers, construction workers, etc. These forklifts can drive under 8 foot passages, and come in two-wheel, four-wheel, and four-wheel crab steering (all wheels are able to turn).</p>
