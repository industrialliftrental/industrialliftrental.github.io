With lift capacities of 5,000, 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, respectively, the three established G Series rough-terrain forklift models offered by Case can be equipped with two mast heights — 15 and 22 feet — to cover most applications. Dayton hand hydraulic pallet trucks are manually operated industrial duty products designed to lift maximum weight.

While many people do lift their trucks strictly for appearance's sake, the main reason to do it is to increase ground clearance and to get the body, frame, and differentials higher. In the mid-1940s, producers started to make rough terrain forklifts.</p>
<h2>Industrial Lift Truck Corp Waynesboro </h2>
<p>Towing: It's easier to tow heavier loads with a lifted truck since your truck won't be as at high of risk of bottoming out. The high-lifting capability of the reach truck makes it an ideal fit for distribution centers facing a shrinking labor pool and pressure to maximize vertical storage space to accommodate inventory growth driven by e-commerce. Forklifts come with safety equipment such as an overhead guard over the operator area in front of the mast and another protecting the driver's seat.</p>
<p>Additionally, ‘Ergolift' allows the operator to raise the high-level order picker forks to a comfortable working height, whilst the position of the hydraulic forks cylinder under the floor and the split controls give unobstructed access to the collecting pallet. There's a wide variety of styles and designs available, some capable of moving loads of 5000lbs, but the main difference is between the lift and pallet trucks.</p>
