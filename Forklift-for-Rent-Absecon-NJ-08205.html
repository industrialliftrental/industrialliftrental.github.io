<p>We carry a variety of pallet jacks, narrow aisle lift trucks, order pickers, and other cushion tire forklifts. The life of Hand Pallet truck as in the case of any other warehouse equipment depends on the usage and the type of load and surface. At SFS, there is a Hand pallet truck to suit every business need.

<p>Rent a forklift with a configuration that makes you most productive. Therefore, a fork lift operator must be able to use the machine to fit large, heavy pallets into relatively small areas, such as large shelving fixtures. When comparing between electric and gas-fueled forklift types, the choice comes down to a warehouse's needs. Their line of forklifts is predictably robust and reliable.</p>
<p>Do not tow or push railway cars or trucks with a forklift. 35 inches or bigger is the common size range for determining whether or not a truck is truly a lifted truck. Add on a 6-inch lift kit and 35-inch tires on 20-inch wheels, and it's simply massive. An alternative to class 3s, tuggers can pull large loads without requiring the equipment to lift it off the ground to do it. This class is used on high traffic sites such as airport landing strips and luggage collection as they are easier to maneuver than a full forklift.</p>
