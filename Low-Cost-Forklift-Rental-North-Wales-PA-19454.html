<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. 2WD rough terrain forklift has strong flexibility with 100% differential lock; 4WD rough terrain forklift adopts traditional technology while imported key components: DANA integrated trans-axle, Sauer Danfoss hydrostatic system, tilting cabin; 4WD compact rough terrain forklift palented self-designed axle &transmission, compact size meet with European standard.</p>
<p>If you are driving a forklift for the first time, one crucial thing to remember is that forklifts are steered by the rear wheels, unlike most cars. Do not alter or eliminate any forklift parts or add any forklift parts or add any accessories such as additional counterweight or lifting attachments unless approved by the manufacturer in writing. Lifted trucks draw attention from everyone on the road and act as giant billboards at local shows, putting that paintjob high up in the sky for everyone to see.</p>
<p>These mobile, self-loading trucks are power-propelled to carry, push, pull, lift, stack or tier material. Reach trucks are used most in warehouses for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights. For example, additional viewing windows have been integrated for added safety and the control panel has been designed to be even more user-friendly.</p>

<p>This is another semi-electric pallet jack truck you might want to check if you are seeking for such. This is an extremely rare type of mast configuration and reduces the lifting capacity of the truck considerably. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>

<p>AUSA Rough Terrain Forklifts are highly versatile machines capable of handling heavy loads and big volumes on rough and sloping terrain. You've seen the big ol' monster trucks on TV, laying waste to everything they drive over. Knowing your required lift height is equally important and will affect your unit's load-carrying capacity. The pallet jack is the little brother to the forklift Generally the heavier a pallet jack is, the more weight it can handle on its rated operating capacity.</p>
<p>Because of their extreme capacity, size and expense , you won't see as many of these trucks around.
