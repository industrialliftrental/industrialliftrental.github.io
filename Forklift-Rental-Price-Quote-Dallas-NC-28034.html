<h3>Used Fork Lift Trucks In Stock Dallas NC 28034</h3>
<p>Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels. Almost identical to the 6,000 lb. 4-wheel, the 6,500 lb. truck has a slightly heavier counterweight. The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it. The name comes from the counterweight in the rear of the vehicle.</p>
<p>We as an organization are acknowledged for engineering a wide range of highly functional Hydraulic Hand Pallet Trucks. No project is the same, which is why Thompson & Johnson carries a diverse forklift rental fleet and offers flexible rental terms ranging from a day to long-term. A work platform of at least 20 inches wide must be securely attached to the lifting carriage or forks.</p>
<p>Rent a forklift with a configuration that makes you most productive. Therefore, a fork lift operator must be able to use the machine to fit large, heavy pallets into relatively small areas, such as large shelving fixtures. When comparing between electric and gas-fueled forklift types, the choice comes down to a warehouse's needs. Their line of forklifts is predictably robust and reliable.</p>
<p>Most standard forklifts are 2 wheel-drive, whilst Agria forklifts are switchable between 2 wheel and full 4 wheel-drive. Suspension lift kits are completely different from body kits in terms of structure. A common complaint amongst drivers of taller vehicles (particularly those driving trucks lifted by more than 6-inches) is the difficulty of finding an insurance provider willing to work with them.</p>
