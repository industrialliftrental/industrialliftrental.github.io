<p>Scenario: You're in the market for a new forklift in Indianapolis You know specifically that you need an electric lift truck with cushion tires that can lift loads up to 4,500 lbs. With the walking operator facing in the direction of travel, with the load trailing, clockwise movement of the steering tongue shall steer the truck clockwise. Unlike Standard Counterbalance and Reach Forklifts, These forklifts are steered via the front swivel articulation of the forklift and are therefore much different to manoeuvre than regular forklifts and additionally have no pantograph feature for retrieving stock in narrow aisles.</p>
<p>Counterbalanced = A lift truck that utilizes weight in its chassis to counterbalance a load against the center line of the drive wheels. Report damaged or excessively worn pallet jacks. Since we are a Waldoch off-road truck dealer, we are always looking to add to our used lifted truck inventory. To provide operator candidates with the knowledge and understanding required to operate an industrial counterbalance forklift truck.</p>

Also, note that loads longer than 48” will extend your load center beyond the standard rating of a 24” load center.</p>
