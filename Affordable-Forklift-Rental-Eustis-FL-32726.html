Clear Lake off-roaders know that for the best performance - and unbeatable styling - nothing beats a lifted RAM 1500 There are many ways to lift your truck - the right one will depend on how you plan to use it and your budget Below we cover two of the most common types of lifts, and the steps you should follow if you don't plan on coming to a body shop for help.</p>
<p>In digging around facts about a forklift rental company, some things you might consider are the company's service level agreements, the age and condition of their forklifts available for rent, as well as the questions they ask to rental enquiries. Our forklift rental fleet is regularly updated with new equipment and maintained according to manufacturer's specifications.</p>

Forklift capacities often range from 3,000 - 7,000 lbs, meaning you can load at least 1,600 lbs on your pallet with the order picker. However, for a warehouse with narrow aisles, having a maneuverable forklift capable of reaching in excess of ten meters makes the reach truck a considerable adversary in the right conditions.</p>
<p>Due to their variety in fueling, size and either a four or three wheel design, counterbalance forklifts are arguably the more versatile of the two trucks. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads. 2It will probably be necessary to cover the surface of the tilting platform with a friction-increasing material such as liquid paint, adhesive applied tape containing friction material, or safety tread with perforated buttons.</p>
