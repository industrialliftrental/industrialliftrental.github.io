<p>TYPES OF FORKLIFTS: fork crane models for industrial use within warehouses, hydraulic three-wheeled electric forklifts, etc. Whether it is while the order picker is moving up and down or during driving, the operator's entire body remains safely within the confines of the truck - aided, among other things, by compact steering and a generous cab area. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use.</p>
<p>AutoNation Chevrolet South Clearwater's inventory is a one-stop shop for custom lifted and supercharged Chevrolet performance trucks.

While most standard forklifts can reach between 10 and 15 feet, a telehandler can lift to heights of 55 feet.</p>
