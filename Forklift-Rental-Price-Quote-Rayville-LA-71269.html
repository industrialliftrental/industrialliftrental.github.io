<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? For tests requiring an elevated load, it may be more convenient to simulate a load by hanging the test load from a framework supported by the forks in the manner described in item 3. This point of suspension, of course, must be on centerline of truck and at a height above forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>
<p>Many lifted truck stores put lifts on high mile trucks, and this can lead to a poor ride and other issues that are associated with lifted vehicles. As a result of the flip-up driver platform and Click-2-Creep, these powered pallet trucks are ideal for working in confined areas and for loading and unloading lorries. The heavy-duty models that can lift big loads have an even larger fork shaft and double wheels at the front.</p>
<p>This internal transport equipment makes loading and unloading more efficiently, which results in a more productive working day. The 3,500 lb. forklift uses the same body style as the 3,000 lb. The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight, which gives the extra 500 lb. capacity. We offer lifted trucks across a variety of models and trim levels, so no matter if you're shopping for a baseline full-size pickup or an upgraded heavy duty model, you can secure whichever you need with a lifted upgrade.</p>
