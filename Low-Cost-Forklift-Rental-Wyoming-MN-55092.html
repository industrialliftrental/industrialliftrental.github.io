<p>Widely demanded by various industries like textile, chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and warehouse, we provideÂ ForkliftsÂ onÂ RentalÂ basis. That said, electric forklifts have a higher upfront cost in comparison to combustion models — as much as 20% to 40% more. If you are looking for a Forklift dealer to handle any or all of your Material Handling needs with the highest of quality, AJ Jersey is the answer. Employers must have a training program that incorporates general principles of safe operation, the types of vehicle(s) used, any hazards created by using forklifts and powered industrial trucks, and OSHA's general safety requirements.</p>
