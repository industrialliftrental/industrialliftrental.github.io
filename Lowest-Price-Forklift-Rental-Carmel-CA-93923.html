Class seven forklifts utilize large floatation type tires for use outdoors on difficult services. If the forklift's mast doesn't provide enough reach, a tower can add a few extra feet.

<p>With capacities ranging from 3,500-18,000 pounds, the 4-Wheel Electric Counter-Balance can be used for specialized heavy lifting applications such as machinery and tool installation.
