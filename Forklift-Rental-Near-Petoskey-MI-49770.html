In recent times, significant growth has been observed owing to the demand for modern material handling equipment Furthermore, forklift manufacturers are also introducing advanced solutions which include integrating Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chips to increase productivity and enhance end-user experience by implementing the multiple-tasks approach in a warehouse.</p>
<p>Toyota's industrial vehicle and equipment business started in March 1956 with lift truck production and sales in Japan. However, the deaths of nearly 100 workers and 20,000 serious injuries that occur each year show that a forklift can be dangerous. Whether you're looking for lifted truck shocks or, specifically, shocks for a 6-inch lift, you can rest assured we'll have what you need.</p>
