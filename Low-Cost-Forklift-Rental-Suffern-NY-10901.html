<p>Forklift is a small industrial vehicle, having a power operated forked platform attached at the front that can be raised and lowered for insertion under a cargo to lift or move it. Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities. Our wide range includes Standard Forks (540 mm), narrow forks (450 mm) wide forks (685 mm) super wide forks (800 mm, 1000 mm) short, long & super long forks (900 mm, 1150 mm, 1220 mm, 1500 mm, 1800 mm, 2500 mm) in minimum fork heights of 36 mm, 51 mm, 75 mm & 85 mm.

Fork lift truck certification is required: Counter Balance, Raymond Reach, Order Picker and Pallet Truck. If you lift a load too high, you can cause the forklift to tip over.</p>
<p>Counterbalanced forklifts are weighted at the rear to prevent the vehicle from tipping forward when lifting a load. Moving mast reach forklifts have a higher ground clearance due to larger wheels, but are unable to handle double deep racking responsibilities without a fork extension attachment.
