<p>The make of the machine, the size of the load, and the ground conditions may affect what speed will prevent accidents.

Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. By applying air pressure to the lift axle, the driver is able to add one more axle into the equation and relieve some of the weight being supported by the other axles.</p>
