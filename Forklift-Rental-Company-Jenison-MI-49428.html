Because of these possibilities, operators should be careful to keep the center of gravity firmly within the stability triangle. Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.</p>
<p>The truck should be equipped with the attachment and the test load (when required) should be representative of the capacity of the truck and attachment combination. So if you need additional materials handling equipment to keep your business up and running, we can help.
