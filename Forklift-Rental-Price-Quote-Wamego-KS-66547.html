<p>Diamond now has separate websites for Equipment and Event Rentals. Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>Four-wheel-drive is usually a selectable system designed to give better performance on broken terrain in low grip road conditions. 3-wheel lifts - used for pallet storage and other minor” tasks, this type of lift has a max load capacity of about 4,800 pounds. In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>
<p>The main safety concern pertains to the lifted vehicle's bumper height from the ground. In addition to this, reach forklifts can be fitted with a camera that shows the driver what is happening above their head on a video screen. But palletisation really enhances the material handling efficiency and throughput. Rough terrain forklifts are larger, stronger and more durable and hence they are pricey than the average forklift.</p>

<p>Because rough terrain vertical mast forklifts are larger and made to handle heavier loads than vertical mast counterbalanced forklifts (classes 1, 4 and 5), they require more space to operate as well as a sturdy surface that offers substantial support.
