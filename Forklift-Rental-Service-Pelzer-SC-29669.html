<p>Most lifted Chevrolet owners don't pay attention to the other portions of their vehicles once they increase its clearance height. An all-steel low lift truck design with the same premise became the first 20th-century innovation that resembled the modern forklift. They feature specially-designed lifting carriages and come in two configurations: with mast and with reach.</p>

With wide selection of lift trucks, Komatsu can meet diversified needs of our customers. If your warehouse is looking for precise and efficient pallet packing, then the reach fork truck may be for you.</p>
