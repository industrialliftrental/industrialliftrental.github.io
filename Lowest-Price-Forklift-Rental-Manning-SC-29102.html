Pallet jacks may seem simple enough to use, but no employee should operate a pallet jack unless they have been trained on safe operation of the pallet jacks used in their current workplace. Forklifts, at maximum, can only travel 8 mph or 3 mph around people, but even at that speed, one of these 4-ton vehicle's steel tusks can puncture your machinery and shut down your operation.</p>

<h3>Important Considerations Before You Sign A Forklift Rental Agreement Manning SC 29102</h3>
<p>Buyer beware takes on particular importance when it comes to forklifts. If a lifted truck's front or rear bumper is 20 inches taller than a car bumper, we are looking at the truck's bumper clearing the car's hood and impacting the windshield. Usually, these lift trucks are free roaming, but can be set up for wire or rail guidance. A suspension lift kit will truly give you that monster truck feeling, as they can be raised as high as practically possible.</p>

These advanced machines are designed to tackle tasks on even the most challenging surfaces. We ensure that we are affordable and always reliable, so you can always count on having the best experience when you service, buy or hire a forklift with us.</p>
