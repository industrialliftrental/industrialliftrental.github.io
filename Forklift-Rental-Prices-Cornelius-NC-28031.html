<p>With so many different types of forklifts , your workplace efficiency and productivity depends on selecting the right equipment for your needs. To use a forklift on a public road, the operator must obtain a forklift (F) endorsement on their driver licence Operators with a class 1 (car) licence and an F endorsement may only operate forklifts up to 18,000 kg gross laden weight, while those holding a class 2 (medium rigid) licence and an F endorsement can operate a forklift of any gross laden weight.</p>

Toyota forklifts are designed and manufactured from the ground up with operator safety, comfort, productivity and efficiency in mind. Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope.</p>

How quickly the picking goes ultimately depends on the truck operator.</p>
<p>Stiff competition and rising concerns regarding the efficacy of pallet trucks are expected to restrain the global market during the forecast period. The counterweight on these trucks juts out much further than the next size down, resulting in a longer truck. Many rough terrain forklifts come with either two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive options. They can be used to speed up movement of items between different workstations This is just the beginning of some of the work places and environments in which pallet jacks can be useful and aid in increasing workplace efficiency and overall effectiveness.</p>

Whether your company deals with distribution and warehousing, or if you need to merely control your own stock, you will need to use the right equipment and machinery to help with the heavy lifting.
