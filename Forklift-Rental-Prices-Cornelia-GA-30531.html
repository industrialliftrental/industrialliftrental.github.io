<p>If you are driving a forklift for the first time, one crucial thing to remember is that forklifts are steered by the rear wheels, unlike most cars. Do not alter or eliminate any forklift parts or add any forklift parts or add any accessories such as additional counterweight or lifting attachments unless approved by the manufacturer in writing. Lifted trucks draw attention from everyone on the road and act as giant billboards at local shows, putting that paintjob high up in the sky for everyone to see.</p>
<p>Employers must certify that operators have received all necessary training and evaluate each operator at least once every three years.

<p>Some of the pallet trucks also independently reduce high speeds when cornering, adjust their drive behavior to the current situation, or help when climbing gradients.

<p>The user should mark, on the sides of the truck, in letters at least 1½ in. high, the actual vehicle weight, the maximum load and the combined weight of the vehicle and capacity load. Because the dimensions of the machine, its weight, the counterbalance, and other elements will define the nominal load that the forklift can handle and lift. An additional set of wheels allows pallet truck to be moved sideways in addition to being the conventional forward and back directions.</p>
