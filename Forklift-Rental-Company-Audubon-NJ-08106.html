Stand-Up Rider = A lift truck designed to be controlled by an operator standing. But if the forklift is put in motion, or sits on a sloping surface, its center of gravity shifts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, with the superior quality in ride characteristics of a system like the Range Rover air suspension and Lincoln Navigator airride, the one downfall is durability.

The growth is driven by the increasing demand for battery-operated trucks and development of the warehouse segment across the region.</p>
