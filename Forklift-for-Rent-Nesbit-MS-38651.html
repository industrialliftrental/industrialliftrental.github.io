<p>Forklifts have come a long way since 1906, when an official of the Pennsylvania Railroad at Altoona, Pa., added storage battery power to a baggage wagon, producing what was probably the first powered platform truck. The added bonus with this machine is that it has a turning circle of just 2.5 m, compared to a standard forklift with fork extensions at 3.7 m,” says Murray.</p>
<p>All you need to do is make sure that you use the forklift as recommended (according to the manufacturer's manual), never overload it, and ensure that only licensed drivers operate it. The maintenance and servicing will then be done on your behalf according to a set schedule.
