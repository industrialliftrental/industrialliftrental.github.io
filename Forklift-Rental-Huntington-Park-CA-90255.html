Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities. Our wide range includes Standard Forks (540 mm), narrow forks (450 mm) wide forks (685 mm) super wide forks (800 mm, 1000 mm) short, long & super long forks (900 mm, 1150 mm, 1220 mm, 1500 mm, 1800 mm, 2500 mm) in minimum fork heights of 36 mm, 51 mm, 75 mm & 85 mm.

<p>Operating from our massive warehouse showroom in Hampshire, we have second hand forklifts and industrial plant machinery for sale which we offer to our global customer base. The term "rough terrain forklift" is a somewhat broad name that often encompasses a number of different machines. Sfikas said all car manufacturers want to know the people who are installing the kits and ensure they are doing so without tampering with the integrity of the vehicle.</p>
<p>Class I vehicles include three-wheel electric sit-down trucks; and high- and low-platform sit-down rider type trucks with cushion tires or pneumatic tires. The Teletruk offers typical savings of up to 30% on operating costs compared to a masted forklift truck. Yet large trucks can't be raised and driven safely until their brakes are modified. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity.</p>

<p>Before starting the forklift, make sure your seat belt is fastened and you can reach all of the controls to drive the forklift.

This much weight would otherwise be too heavy for a standard 12,000 lb. truck to lift. Battery-operated reach trucks are gaining popularity among end use industries, owing to their ability to handle double pallet and horizontal transport.</p>
<p>Decrease speed at all corners, sound horn and watch the swing of both the rear of the lift truck and the load.

While most know forklifts the main function of material handling, in fact, there are many different categories of these.</p>

You'll need hangars, four-links, airbags, and custom driveline equipment once you start going so big, just don't forget the ladder.
