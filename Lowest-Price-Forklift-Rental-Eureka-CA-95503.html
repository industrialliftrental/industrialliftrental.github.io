<p>PA Industrial Equipment, Inc. HIGH-LIFT PLATFORM TRUCK: A self-loading truck equipped with a load platform, intended primarily for transporting and tiering loaded skid platforms (Fig. OSHA General Industry Standard 1910.178()(1) Only stable or safely arranged loads shall be handled. Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation to avoid tipovers and accidents.</p>
<p>These devices are often mistaken for cranes and are able to reach heights and angles that standard lift trucks cannot. Because of the high initial cost, almost all forklifts are either rented or financed. Lift and remove various loads using the full working height of the forklift. Open view 3-stage mast gives operators a clear line of sight to the load for increased efficiency and reduced product damage (4,000 lbs.</p>
<p>By using the know-how gained from years of experience in production of industrial vehicles and the latest technologies, Komatsu markets a variety of lift trucks, including small-to large-sized engine-powered lift trucks, battery-powered lift trucks, and HST-drive lift trucks. In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation.</p>
