CLARK Material Handling Corporation built the Tructractor, and have maintained a presence in the forklift field ever since then. Adding a Pro Comp lift kit to your vehicle will help to maintain vehicle ride height, reduce the effect of shock forces, maintain wheel alignment, support loaded weight, and control the direction of travel for your truck or SUV.</p>
