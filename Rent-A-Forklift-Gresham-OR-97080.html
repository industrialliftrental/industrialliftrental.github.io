Considered the most common type of forklift truck overall, counterbalanced models are designed with a weight that's built into the rear of the truck's body. A lift's forks offer the best evidence of how it was employed revealing if the machine was overloaded or abused during operation.</p>
<p>The following tests are designed to verify rated capacities of Narrow-Aisle-Rider fork trucks having rated capacities up to and including 10,000 lb at 24-inch load center and to determine capacity or alternate rated capacities. Narrow aisle forklifts like walkie stackers and side loaders can measure less than 5 ft. However, if you are using a forklift in a warehouse setting, it is important to consider the aisle width.</p>
<p>Reality: the higher a heavy load is lifted, the less safe a forklift becomes. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. By applying air pressure to the lift axle, the driver is able to add one more axle into the equation and relieve some of the weight being supported by the other axles.</p>
