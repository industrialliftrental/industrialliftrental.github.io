Talk to us anytime about what you would like to achieve regarding your business material handling requirements so we are able to help you with a solution that will best meet your needs and budget.</p>
<p>The average car bumper height is approximately 20 inches lower than the average lifted truck or SUV. Our flexible hire options are designed to suit your business needs and our experienced staff can help you find exactly the right solution, whether it's a lift truck for the day or a forklift for six months to five years, with full maintenance included.

JCB material handling equipment is renowned and appreciated in the construction sector, the JCB 926 , 930 and 940 models are particularly known for their reliability, versatility, mobility and ease of use. For Private Individuals it is recommended that you click on the following link with information on CPCS Training and the Private Individual , before making a specific enquiry relating to a Rough Terrain Forklift training course.</p>
<p>If you imagine all three points connected into a triangle, this is the forklift's stability triangle. A large suv or more often truck that has had longer suspension components nailed on it to increase ground clearance. A lifted suspension, though it's protected from scraping over rocks and debris, responds differently to this stress; if you lift your Jeep's suspension, your standard shocks might not do the trick.</p>

Simple does not mean you should try to install this kind of lift kit yourself, however, unless you have a lot of experience with working on truck frames and bodies and the right equipment to do it safely.</p>
