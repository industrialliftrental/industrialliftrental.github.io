<h3>Forklift Truck Sales Waldwick NJ</h3>
<p>One of the main safety risks for order pickers is falling from height when exiting the cabin onto pallets, partially enclosed platforms or racking. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test OP1, or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable.

<p>For high lift operations, the BT Reflex E-series features a unique tilting cab, which reduces driver strain whilst offering safer and more accurate load handling resulting in a high amount of pallet movement. But where a straight mast forklift really differs is in the maneuverability and accessibility it provides through large heavy-duty pneumatic cushion tires that enable the lift to traverse rough terrain as easily as any other equipment on the job site.</p>
<p>When using them in a warehouse, it is important to bear in mind that the lifting height of these forklifts is usually limited to 24.6 feet and that the normal working aisle adapted to these elements must provide 10.5 feet to 11.5 feet of free space. Air Lift's products line include the "Air Lift 1000", "Ride Control 59500" and the "Load Lifter 5000" suspension air bags.</p>
