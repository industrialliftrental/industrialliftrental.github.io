<p>This series includes lift trucks that can lift loads from 1 t to 8 t. The models are split into three categories, starting with the 1-3,5-t models. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. While you'll typically use a rough terrain forklift outdoors, some models can operate indoors.
