<p>Welcome to the home of Doosan Forklifts in the UK. The Forklift Trucks Market in Asia Pacific is likely to witness the highest growth in the coming years. This increases road clearance and makes the vehicle appear to be larger than stock vehicles. Dealerships generally charge extra for forklifts that are returned with damage. Whether you need low level pickers, or turret truck pickers, you'll find the machine that best fits your needs below.</p>
<p>These forklifts are known for what their name indicates, their ability to lift loads at a high altitude. Because of these possibilities, operators should be careful to keep the center of gravity firmly within the stability triangle. Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.</p>
<p>This series includes lift trucks that can lift loads from 1 t to 8 t. The models are split into three categories, starting with the 1-3,5-t models. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. While you'll typically use a rough terrain forklift outdoors, some models can operate indoors.
