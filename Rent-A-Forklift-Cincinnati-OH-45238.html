<h3>Two Drum Spill Pallet Cincinnati OH 45238</h3>
<p>Our rental fleet stands ready to supply you with immediate equipment when a need arises. After working in the distribution industry for over 16 years, it has been very difficult to find a trustworthy and fairly priced independent material handling mechanic.

<p>There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front. Turret Trucks are battery operated machines that use both the electric engine, battery and operator compartment to counterweigh heavy loads. Safety on and off the road is the foremost issue concerning all lifted vehicles.</p>
<p>This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected. With so many advantages being offered by the electric forklift and electric reach stacker, it's clear to see why these pieces of equipment are increasing in popularity in the material handling industry.</p>
<p>Reality: the higher a heavy load is lifted, the less safe a forklift becomes. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. By applying air pressure to the lift axle, the driver is able to add one more axle into the equation and relieve some of the weight being supported by the other axles.</p>
