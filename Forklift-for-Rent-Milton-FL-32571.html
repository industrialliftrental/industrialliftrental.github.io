<p>Turning Radius = The radius of a circle created by outmost projection of a lift truck when the operator has the steering mechanism in the tightest turning position. These manual pallet jacks each feature a narrow fork design with entry glides and exit rollers to help allow easier access to smaller pallets with decks up to 24"W. In an electric forklift the large battery may serve as part of the counterweight.</p>
<p>As forklift operators need to sit in their machine for hours together, a high-quality adjustable seat is essential. Front suspension drop-down brackets, or a crossmember cradle, allow the vehicle's suspension pickup points to be relocated at a lower position, which allows the vehicle to be lifted without changing the suspension's travel and steering geometry.</p>
<p>Therefore, no matter what the specific characteristics are of the individual pallet jack, it is still one of the most versatile and usable pieces of moving equipment for any business to have readily available for everyday use. Whether you want to lift up your truck, come in for routine maintenance, or just have some concerns about something going on with your vehicle, we are here to answer your questions and help keep you safe on the road.</p>
