Any time the forklift's center of gravity moves outside the stability triangle, the lift will tip over. Generally, the forklift's wheels and frame are designed for a specific tire type, so check the forklift's manual before going with a different tire type than what is recommended.</p>
<p>Electric Hydraulic Pallet Truck is appreciated for their resistance to abrasion, wear and tear resistance and toughness. Pallet trucks are used for unloading and stuffing goods that are delivered on the pallet such as cartons and tinned goods. Agria forklifts are able to navigate slopes with gradients of up to 38% offering superior operation over rough terrain.</p>
