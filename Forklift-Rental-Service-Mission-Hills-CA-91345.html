<p>Texas First Rentals will remain open during the COVID-19 outbreak to safely serve customers across our territory. Year-end forklift truck sales of 260,180 included electric rider trucks (Class 1 and Class 2 combined), motorized hand trucks (Class 3) and internal combustion powered trucks (Class 4 and Class 5 combined). With the test load supported by the forks in a normal and unrestrained manner, the forks in fully retracted position (if retractable), and the mast at full rearward tilt permitted by the truck mechanism, elevate the load to its maximum height.</p>

Repair or replacement - if your forklift breaks down at any time, we will repair or replace it normally within 2 to 3 hours, depending on your location.</p>

A body lift kit is installed by removing the body of a truck from its frame and installing blocks or spacers between the two, then reattaching the body to the frame.
