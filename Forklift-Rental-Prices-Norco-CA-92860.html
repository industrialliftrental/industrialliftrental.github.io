This will determine the kind of forklift needed to be able to maneuver through the space in which the truck is working.</p>
<h2>Pallet Jack For Sale Norco</h2>
<p>The "bread and butter" forklift, this is the most common type of forklift that you'll see around. Typically, these types of vehicles are known as forklifts or lift trucks.

<p>Forklifts are designed to lessen the load for you. Pallet jacks offer sturdy steel construction and often feature cushion grip handles for comfort.

The global pallet truck market can be segmented in terms of operating mode, lifting capacity, end-user, distribution channel, and region.</p>
