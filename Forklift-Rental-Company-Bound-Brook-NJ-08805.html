<p>JCB rough terrain forklifts are a reliable, comfortable, versatile and easy-to-use solution for any challenging rehandling environment. In a stand-up forklift, most often they require the use of a joystick which can present a learning curve to some operators. Our rental lift trucks are maintained to the industry's highest standards and undergo comprehensive pre-rental inspections to ensure consistent performance and reliable operations. Also for rent, sit-down, stand-on or walk-behind forklifts.</p>

Category includes box trucks, maintenance trucks, forklifts, tow trucks, flatbed trucks, electric carts. Rough terrain forklifts, often known as telehandlers, are engineered for operation on some of the most extreme terrain and climatic conditions.</p>
