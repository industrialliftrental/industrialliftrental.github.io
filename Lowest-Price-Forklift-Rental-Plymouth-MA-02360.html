<p>Texas First Rentals will remain open during the COVID-19 outbreak to safely serve customers across our territory. That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>
<p>These forklifts are known for what their name indicates, their ability to lift loads at a high altitude. Because of these possibilities, operators should be careful to keep the center of gravity firmly within the stability triangle. Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.</p>
