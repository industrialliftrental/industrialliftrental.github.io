To maximise flexibility for the driver and increase productivity, EP has developed the JX1, a professional order picker with a 20% higher pickrate per hour and a picking height of up to 6.5m.</p>
<p>The additional height means your truck is more likely to flip and rollover in the event of a roadway emergency that involves tight handling. The hours of operation are more important than the year model when it comes to buying used forklifts. The purpose of a lift axle is to place the vehicle's total weight over a broader area, thereby allowing the vehicle to meet weight-imposed restrictions on certain roads.</p>
<p>Hyster forklifts are built tough, with cutting-edge technology and innovative designs. Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. Often, a driver will raise the axle to enable the vehicle to turn easier and not have to drag the lift axle sideways through a turn.</p>
<p>We understand that determining the best used forklift for your specific needs is difficult. Key parts like your brakes, suspension system, and tires will need to be refreshed more often than if you drove a non-lifted truck. This is ideal if you have multiple loads in one bay that you can access from different angles, as the truck can grab loads further back.</p>
