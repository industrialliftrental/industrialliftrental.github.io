<p>To eliminate the chance of combustion, all electrical components in an explosion-proof forklift are completely sealed. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Rough terrain forklifts are designed for two things: lifting and moving loads.</p>

<p>This version is known as a deep-reach lift truck. The most common type of forklift has a heavy counterweight over the rear tires to balance the load. Standard counterbalance forklifts require aisles of approximately 13 ft wide to effectively turn, navigate, and move pallets. All operators are required to wear a harness while operating any order picker at any height.</p>
<p>JCB RT forklift models include the 930, 940, and 950, respectively rated at 6,000, 8,000, and 10,000 pounds lift capacity. Although lifted trucks can make hitting the trail a lot easier, they do have some drawbacks that you want to keep in mind before committing to one.
