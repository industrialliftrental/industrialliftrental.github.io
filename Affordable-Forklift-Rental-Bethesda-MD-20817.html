Our hand pallet trucks represent a cost-effective solution for many transport tasks involving short distances. But most warehouses are more sophisticated than that and require moving materials heavier and higher than a hand truck can go. They may use a fleet of forklifts, without any injury or accident to speak of.</p>
<p>The additional height means your truck is more likely to flip and rollover in the event of a roadway emergency that involves tight handling. The hours of operation are more important than the year model when it comes to buying used forklifts. The purpose of a lift axle is to place the vehicle's total weight over a broader area, thereby allowing the vehicle to meet weight-imposed restrictions on certain roads.</p>
<p>Our rentals have the flexibility for daily, weekly or monthly rentals and allow you flexibility in your material handling needs. There are a lot of great reasons why you would want to rent a forklift versus buying one new. Class VI forklifts are sit-down rider, tow tractor lifts. Make sure that forklift operators are given formal instruction, hands on training and periodic evaluation.</p>
