<p>PA Industrial Equipment, Inc. If you are currently operating order picking forklift trucks under supervision for at least six (6) months in any setting (e.g. transport and logistic industry) and wish to obtain a plant licence, bring a letter from the employer and sample pages of the order picker Logbook you have completed over this period (this will determine the time you should spend on studies - at home and at AWFTC).</p>
<p>Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines. Rough terrain forklifts help your crew move materials, supplies, and workers safely.

<p>We offer competitive pricing for both our short and long-term rentals and provide prompt delivery throughout the Mid-Atlantic region.

<p>Ease of operations: New forklifts will have new features that may puzzle even the most experienced operators. A warning light must automatically activate when an order picker's platform is six feet or higher and the forklift is in motion. Like the pallets themselves, pallet jacks have become a lot more standardized in North America as of late. Also, note that loads longer than 48” will extend your load center beyond the standard rating of a 24” load center.</p>

The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
<p>Our renowned build quality, coupled with safety innovations such as the ‘Presence Detection System' (PDS and PDS+), gives our counterbalance forklift trucks a competitive edge; helping you to improve your operational efficiency. These kits cannot be installed in vehicles with a unibody construction, such as the Jeep Cherokee. Powered by large, heavy lead-acid batteries, electric forklifts typically provide enough power for one standard eight-hour shift or about five to six hours of continuous use.</p>
