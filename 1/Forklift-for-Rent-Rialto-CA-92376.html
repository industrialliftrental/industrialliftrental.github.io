<p>Electric forklift not holding charge? Lifting capacity and weight will also vary whether it's manual or electric. Operate trucks equipped with attachments as partially loaded trucks when not handling a load. The second type is a body lift kit, which raises your truck between one and three inches and allows you to keep your standard tires while giving them a wider margin from the body. In contrast, renting a rough terrain forklift can help you keep your costs in check.</p>
<p>Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines. Rough terrain forklifts help your crew move materials, supplies, and workers safely.

We have specialized in new and used forklift sales in Surrey, Vancouver and surrounding areas for over 41 years.
