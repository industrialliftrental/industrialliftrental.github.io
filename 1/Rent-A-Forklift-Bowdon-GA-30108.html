<p>AUSA Rough Terrain Forklifts are highly versatile machines capable of handling heavy loads and big volumes on rough and sloping terrain. You've seen the big ol' monster trucks on TV, laying waste to everything they drive over. Knowing your required lift height is equally important and will affect your unit's load-carrying capacity.
