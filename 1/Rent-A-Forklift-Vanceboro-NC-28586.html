If you are looking for a Forklift dealer to handle any or all of your Material Handling needs with the highest of quality, AJ Jersey is the answer. Employers must have a training program that incorporates general principles of safe operation, the types of vehicle(s) used, any hazards created by using forklifts and powered industrial trucks, and OSHA's general safety requirements.</p>

<p>Lift & place 3 loads onto truck bed (75mm tolerance) and remove upon completion. Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position.

<p>While some may know forklifts primarily as a material handling appliance, there are in fact many different categories of forklifts. For starters, Crown's OnTrac Anti-Slip Traction Control on its narrow aisle reach trucks uses the forklift's on-board control system to determine whether the truck is losing traction. This is not always a terrible thing, but it often takes some getting used to, especially if you have driven the standard model and then change to a lifted truck.</p>
