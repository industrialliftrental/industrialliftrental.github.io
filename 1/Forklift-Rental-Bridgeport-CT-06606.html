<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Check to make sure that the pallet jack is not on the cross wood of the skid, front wheels must be on the floor.

We supply electric and propane forklifts with the option of a narrow aisle style. The Mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets. It is not uncommon for the lift axle to operate with a much smaller tire, however, the tire is often of a greater ply rating and able to support more weight than the larger truck tires.</p>

Whether you need a compact electric lift truck for your narrow aisles, a big boy 110,000 lb. lift for your quarry operation or anything in between, you can count on Altorfer Cat.
