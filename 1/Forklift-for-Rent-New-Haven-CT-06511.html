<p>At Westminster Lift Truck Services, we always recommend that with the money needed for buying a new forklift, you can buy more used forklifts to improve your workforce productivity and have the budget for minor maintenance. The load of the forks must be balanced by the weight of the lift truck in order for this principle to work. With their stronger frames, they can lift heavier loads higher than forklifts that operate in warehouses, for example.</p>
