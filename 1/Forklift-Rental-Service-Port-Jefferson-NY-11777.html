<p>Equipment Solutions for Your Short and Long-term Rental Needs. Our 2-Day Order Picker Course ( LO Licence ) is designed for students who are complete beginners to students with years of experience operating an Order Picker. Experienced Worker CPCS Forklift course - this course lasts 2 days and will consist of theory training on the first day, and CPCS theory and practical technical tests on the second. Hand trucks are used for manual movement of non-palletized, unstacked loads.</p>
<p>We've performed many lifted truck services and we are proud of the work we've done. Keep all parts of your body inside the industrial lift truck when travelling; travel with the forks as low to the floor as possible; decrease speed around corners and sound the horn; and, travel in reverse when a load obstructs your vision. You shouldn't ever buy forklifts that haven't had a Thorough Examinations test done, and you shouldn't purchase from a forklift sales dealer who doesn't know the ins and outs of lifting equipment.</p>
<p>A sit-down forklift fills a constant need to move equipment and materials that are too heavy for workers to move. Lift Capacity: 16000 lbs. Our AC Orderpicker trucks use fewer amps per cycle, so you'll save on batteries, chargers and downtime. Check the areas around and behind your vehicle before putting it in reverse, even if that means you need to temporarily turn the truck off, hop down out of the driver's seat and do a quick check for any children or pedestrians in the area.</p>

<p>If alternate capacities are shown for elevations lower than maximum, alternate capacities not shown may be 2 assumed to fall on a straight line between the capacity and the alternate capacities shown for each load center. Rated capacity of the truck must be visible by the operator. Lifting Pallets: The most popular way to put rough terrain forklifts to work is by lifting pallets.</p>
<p>The articulated forklift is suited to narrow aisles and the loading or offloading of trucks. Sit-down forklifts are also more accessible to a wider pool of forklift operators for that reason. Test N5 - both reach and straddle trucks (except with tilting mast) - stability is usually obvious, in which case test may be waived. The suspension lift kit helps drivers conquer uneven and off-road terrain.</p>
<h2>Pallet Truck Port Jefferson</h2>
<p>Reduced Downtime At Your Facility - During scheduled or emergency repairs our Rental and Service Departments can work together to provide you with trucks on rent to cover your shifts while your machines are in the shop. This much weight would otherwise be too heavy for a standard 12,000 lb. truck to lift. Battery-operated reach trucks are gaining popularity among end use industries, owing to their ability to handle double pallet and horizontal transport.</p>
<p>If low clearances are an issue, CASE offers freelift masts that allow you to raise the forks 5 ft off the ground prior to the mast protruding, keeping your overall travel height lower.

Green Spaces: Since rough terrain forklifts can handle loose ground and can move backfill, they work well in green spaces.</p>
