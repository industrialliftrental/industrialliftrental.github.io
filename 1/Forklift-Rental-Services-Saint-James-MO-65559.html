Masslift Africa is the sole distributor of Mitsubishi forklifts in Southern Africa. The 8,000 lb. electric 4-wheel is used in higher capacity operations. This involves driving the pallet jack throughout the warehouse, collecting different products on the order sheet, and safely getting out of the warehouse to load the orders onto a truck or other shipping vehicle.</p>

The powered pallet jack is generally moved by a throttle on the handle to move forward or in reverse and steered by swinging the handle in the intended direction. Material handling is an essential business. The 56 hp version feels underwhelming compared to some other forklifts such as the Caterpillar.</p>
