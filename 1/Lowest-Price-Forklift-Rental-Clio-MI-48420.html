Operate trucks equipped with attachments as partially loaded trucks when not handling a load. The second type is a body lift kit, which raises your truck between one and three inches and allows you to keep your standard tires while giving them a wider margin from the body. In contrast, renting a rough terrain forklift can help you keep your costs in check.</p>

An alternative to class 3s, tuggers can pull large loads without requiring the equipment to lift it off the ground to do it. This class is used on high traffic sites such as airport landing strips and luggage collection as they are easier to maneuver than a full forklift.</p>
