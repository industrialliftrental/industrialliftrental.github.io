<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? For tests requiring an elevated load, it may be more convenient to simulate a load by hanging the test load from a framework supported by the forks in the manner described in item 3. This point of suspension, of course, must be on centerline of truck and at a height above forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>
<p>Reach trucks are categorized as Class 2 lift trucks in material handling. The next huge advance in the forklift industry involved the electric engine. Electric forklifts are suited for indoor use and have several advantages. Forklifts help one person do the work of many when it comes to moving heavy pallets of goods inside a warehouse. Electric forklifts don't generate polluting emissions, and although they are usually the most expensive to buy, they are the cheapest in terms of operating costs.</p>

A forklift can overturn sideways if the center of gravity leaves the stability triangle on either of the two sides.</p>
