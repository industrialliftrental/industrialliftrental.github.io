First, the fact that your forklift is rented means that you aren't solely responsible for its upkeep and maintenance. This type of truck, unlike Articulated Narrow Aisle Trucks, requires a high standard of floor flatness. A part of the warranty, we include maintenance kits with the machines, so you can forget about additional costs when you receive your Bomaq forklift.</p>
<p>If you are driving a forklift for the first time, one crucial thing to remember is that forklifts are steered by the rear wheels, unlike most cars. Do not alter or eliminate any forklift parts or add any forklift parts or add any accessories such as additional counterweight or lifting attachments unless approved by the manufacturer in writing. Lifted trucks draw attention from everyone on the road and act as giant billboards at local shows, putting that paintjob high up in the sky for everyone to see.</p>

Moving mast reach forklifts have a higher ground clearance due to larger wheels, but are unable to handle double deep racking responsibilities without a fork extension attachment. If these tests are used to determine capacity or alternate rated capacities, use appropriate loads and load centers instead of those herein specified.</p>
