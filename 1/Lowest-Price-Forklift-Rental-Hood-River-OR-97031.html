<p>This course is designed to provide experienced operators with relevant knowledge and understanding of practical use of the Industrial Counterbalance Forklift. In the Guru, when referring to overall width for class 2 & 3 trucks, overall width refers to the width of the power unit, not the outriggers. Specifically, adding such a large lift kit or monstrous wheels and tires can make daily driving around the city a real chore. No matter what size or capacity you need, you can find a rough terrain forklift for the job.</p>
<p>Lift and tow heavy or extremely large loads efficiently and safely in rough terrain environments with power and precision. Lift Capacity: 6000 lbs. The pallet jack drop lever is often a small lever in the middle of the rounded handle, on the vertical stem of the manual machine. Drivers can expect a wide-range of truck body styles and capabilities in addition to automakers at Gibson Truck World.</p>
<p>With capacities ranging from 3,500-18,000 pounds, the 4-Wheel Electric Counter-Balance can be used for specialized heavy lifting applications such as machinery and tool installation. About 92% of these are forklifts, 1% are material handling equipment parts.
