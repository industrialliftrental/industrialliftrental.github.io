<p>SCA Performance RAM trucks are some of the most powerful and performance-ready lifted trucks in the industry. Many of these Custom and Lifted trucks are featured in some of the highest trim levels and many come standard with I6, V6 or V8 engines, meaning you just might get a lot more powertrain, torque and convenient technological amenities for your money; such features include front dual-zone climate control, front and rear parking sensors, adjustable pedals, a built-in navigation system or a HomeLink Universal Garage Door Opener.</p>
<p>These forklifts are known for what their name indicates, their ability to lift loads at a high altitude. Because of these possibilities, operators should be careful to keep the center of gravity firmly within the stability triangle. Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.</p>
<p>These low-reach forklifts are suitable for double floor stacking and low-level racking and shelving operations. Means shall be provided for an operator on the elevatable platform to shut off the power to the truck.

A large suv or more often truck that has had longer suspension components nailed on it to increase ground clearance. A lifted suspension, though it's protected from scraping over rocks and debris, responds differently to this stress; if you lift your Jeep's suspension, your standard shocks might not do the trick.</p>
