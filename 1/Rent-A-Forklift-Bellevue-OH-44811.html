<p>There are a few different types of counterbalance forklifts. We take care of the maintenance of all of our rental forklifts for you. Ask what kind of lift it is, who installed it and if there have been any problems with it. Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies.</p>
<p>BT Quick Lifters are available with ‘quick-lift' feature, which means that it takes just two strokes of the pump unit to elevate the load. Do not steer pallet jacks onto uneven surfaces and avoid steep inclines. A pallet jack scale or a pallet truck scale can typically lift 120 mm. It is nearly impossible for a driver of a towering tow vehicle to see the tiny cars in front of him, measly pedestrians, or even unpredictable bike riders.</p>

It will mean you can drive 99% of all forklift trucks in the UK. As you already have experience, and the training is shorter, the cost for this is less than the beginner training.</p>
