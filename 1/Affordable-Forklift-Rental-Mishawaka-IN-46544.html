<p>A lifted truck, often referred to as a 4x4 truck, is a modified vehicle specially designed for off road driving and other types of high-impact work. More and more drivers from Phoenix to Glendale and everywhere in between are in the market for a pre-owned vehicle over shopping for a new car, truck or SUV. There are three known types of industrial reach forklifts: stand-up trucks, double-deep trucks, and straddle trucks.</p>

Your day-to-day duties will include unloading goods from trucks, ships or aircrafts, and moving them to the correct place.</p>
<p>Reality: the higher a heavy load is lifted, the less safe a forklift becomes. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. By applying air pressure to the lift axle, the driver is able to add one more axle into the equation and relieve some of the weight being supported by the other axles.</p>
