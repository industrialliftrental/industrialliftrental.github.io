<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height for the limit of travel speed, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified by Graph C about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
<p>These forklifts are known for what their name indicates, their ability to lift loads at a high altitude. Because of these possibilities, operators should be careful to keep the center of gravity firmly within the stability triangle. Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.</p>
<p>For pallet jacks that can weigh for dual efficiency, contact METTLER TOLEDO. We recommend this pallet jack due to its' heavy duty structure and its affordability. They also build gas, diesel, and electric engines for their forklifts. They have dual forks at the front of the truck and a weight in the back to offset the weight of the load in the front. It is the highest capacity stockpicker in the line, handling heavy palletized loads at heights up to 366 inches.</p>
