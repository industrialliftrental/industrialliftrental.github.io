Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it.

The heavy-duty models that can lift big loads have an even larger fork shaft and double wheels at the front.</p>
