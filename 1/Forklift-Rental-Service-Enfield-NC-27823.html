The first step toward buying the pre-designed lifted truck for you is to determine exactly what it is you're looking for in a vehicle of this type.</p>

Here at Ultimate Rides, we breath eat and sleep lifted 4×4 trucks and jeeps. On new forklifts we offer up to 72 months of either a $1 buyout or a True FMV lease option. Suspension lift kits can raise a truck a full foot from where it started, and they aren't just lifting up the truck's body and putting it back again.</p>
