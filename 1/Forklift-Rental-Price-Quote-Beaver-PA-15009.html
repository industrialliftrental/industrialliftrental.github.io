<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. Due to its smaller forklift dimensions, the pallet jack is not capable of lifting heavy weight. Two or three forklifts are usually shipped on the same load to minimize the freight charges. If you are driving aggressively in a lifted vehicle, it is a lot easier to spot the infraction and track your lifted truck down. Pallet jacks can cost less than $500 and powered hand trucks less than $3,000.</p>
<p>Four-wheel-drive is usually a selectable system designed to give better performance on broken terrain in low grip road conditions. 3-wheel lifts - used for pallet storage and other minor‚Äù tasks, this type of lift has a max load capacity of about 4,800 pounds. In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>
<p>Hand-pallet trucks (aka pump trucks) are non-powered tools used to move palletised loads; typically up to 5500 lbs. Powered by energy efficient AC motors, the BT Reflex R-series and E-series of reach trucks are best suited to forklift applications involving high lifting with heavy loads. Forklifts have a stability triangle. We are one of the most reliable supplier of heavy equipments like forklifts, cranes, earth moving and other material handling equipments.</p>

<p>Flexibility is perhaps the greatest benefit to renting a forklift versus buying. Polyurethane tires are incompatible with outdoor terrain and are therefore only installed on electric lifts that are used on smooth interior pavements and loading pads. Fork lift truck certification is required: Counter Balance, Raymond Reach, Order Picker and Pallet Truck. If you lift a load too high, you can cause the forklift to tip over.</p>
<p>Forklift accidents account for 10% of all physical injuries in the workplace. Thanks, Damoli for the next day service when booking my forklift in for an emergency service, guys were on time and very helpful. Adoption of forklifts for lifting various types of materials, such as steel, wood, and mortar, by the construction industry to transfer heavy goods and reduce mishandling is driving industry growth.</p>

<p>Rentals are a repeat business - your customers only rent your equipment for a period of time, so if they need it again in the future they have to rent again. A forklift that cannot tolerate the amount of weight to the proper height is not only a waste of time and money, but very dangerous.

Step into the forklift operator's seat and fasten the seatbelt. Torcan has been offering its customers with quality personnel and exceptional services in material handling equipment. In a sense, reach trucks are far more "customizable" for a specific lifting task than sit-down forklifts could ever hope to be.</p>
