Employers must have a training program that incorporates general principles of safe operation, the types of vehicle(s) used, any hazards created by using forklifts and powered industrial trucks, and OSHA's general safety requirements.</p>

The answer is similar to electric forklifts above.</p>

To avoid accidents, the operator should always remember to stack the loads evenly across the pallet and that they are balanced.</p>
