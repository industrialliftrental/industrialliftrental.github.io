As an operator of a counterbalance forklift, you could find yourself in many different types of workplaces; from constructions sites to ports, warehouses, storage yards and factories. Whether working within the tight quarters of a semi trailer, stacking loads on the dock or handling put-away and retrieval within warehouse racks, the SC Series provides operators with the capability and confidence needed to position loads with precision.</p>
<p>Discuss the hazards so they know what can occur if they do not practice the right safety habits when driving their forklifts. They are the leading lift truck business on the planet. Body lift kits are typically constructed from plastic or polyurethane with a height of around 1 to 3 inches. The forks are the most visible parts of any rough terrain forklift. You will also need to know what the required turning radius is, and also, the minimum aisle width the lift truck will be working in. This will determine the kind of forklift needed to be able to maneuver through the space in which the truck is working.</p>
