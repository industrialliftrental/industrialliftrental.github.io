<p>We have access to many brands, so we will have a Forklift solution that fits your requirements. Each of these types of lift trucks have many configurations to meet the need of your specific application.

UniCarriers offers a wide range of equipment designed to fit all applications backed by the best limited warranty in the business. When you rent a lift truck, we'll be there to provide assistance with delivery, training and, if necessary, maintenance and service support.</p>
<p>Look out for any uneven surfaces that could result in technical difficulties for the stability and longevity of your reach forklift. Lifted cars have the potential to run right over smaller vehicles in the event of a high-speed accident. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident, because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.</p>
<p>With the largest rental fleet in Alabama and Northwest Florida, Thompson Lift Truck has what it takes to keep your business moving.

Shifting Supplies: Whether or not your supplies are palletized, you can shift them around with a rough terrain forklift. While the dealer insures the equipment, you'll want to make sure your company's insurance covers the operator, other people at your facility and the facility in the event of an injury or property damage when the rented forklift is in use.</p>

<p>A parking mechanism shall be provided and capable of holding the truck on the maximum grade which the truck can negotiate with rated capacity load, or on a 15 percent grade, whichever is the lesser. Larger tires and wheels have much more mass that will need stronger and larger brakes in order to allow the vehicle to safely come to a complete stop. Additionally, if you're towing a heavy load, a lifted suspension provides the benefit of having more room to settle before the weight of the load bottoms out.</p>
