<p>Our forklifts are widely demanded by various industries like textile, warehouse, chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, aviation, glass, ceremics, construction, beverages, automobile OEM & its Ancillary unit. Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
<p>Whether you need to move or lift material - on solid ground or mud, rocks, hillsides, and other rough terrain - we have the reliable and rugged equipment to help you get your construction or industrial job done right. Repair or replacement - if your forklift breaks down at any time, we will repair or replace it normally within 2 to 3 hours, depending on your location.</p>
<p>The Company offers forklifts, lift trucks, dumpers, compactors, screeds, trowels, and telehandlers, as well as repairs and maintenance services. While many people do lift their trucks strictly for appearance's sake, the main reason to do it is to increase ground clearance and to get the body, frame, and differentials higher. In the mid-1940s, producers started to make rough terrain forklifts.</p>

The types of conditions that order pickers work in are as varied as the different types of warehouses or distribution centers. Without a counterbalance license and counterbalance forklift license training, your employees aren't able to operate forklifts.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load at maximum elevation shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a slope of 4 percent about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang. Contact used forklift dealers and other possible sellers.</p>
