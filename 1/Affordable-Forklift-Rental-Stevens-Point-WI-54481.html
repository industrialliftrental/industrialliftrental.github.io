Great customer service, I highly recommend the team at Damoli Forklifts.

<p>This entire class-leading range of hand pallet trucks has proven to be extremely durable and are therefore used in every industry. Forks can do many jobs, but they can't move loose ground or smaller materials. In order to be able to pick up heavy loads at the front, a forklift has to be even heavier at the back. The pallet jack also features a durable sealed pump with overload safety system.</p>
<p>Transmissions on forklifts, in particular, can be subject to abuse. Optional bionic controls, four available configurations integrated directly into the armrest, place all of the forklift's hydraulic functions close at hand. These forklifts are different from ordinary industrial forklifts, as they are extra-strong and rugged vehicles, that look a little bit like a tractor.</p>

<p>This forklift has a three-wheel variant that allows the operator to turn and maneuver in circles.

<p>The reach forklift also features low under-carriage clearance and so we recommend that, prior to purchasing, you survey when the truck would be in operation. Visit your local big-box superstore like Costco's, Sam's Club, Lowe's or Home Depot, and it's hard not to notice all those forklifts. A forklift is made out of a fork, a control unit, a motor and a counterweight.</p>
