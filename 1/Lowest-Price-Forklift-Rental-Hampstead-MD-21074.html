<p>Quality parts for all lift trucks and all lift truck needs. Reaping those benefits, however, requires an array of skills and knowledge to operate these vehicles responsibly on site—skills and knowledge that have to be validated, either by third-party safety trainers, like myself, or by individuals who have attended training-the-trainer-type classes (more on this below), or by the vendors renting the equipment.</p>
<p>You can find a range of other new and used equipment in our inventory, which makes Thompson Lift Truck your one-stop shop whenever you need equipment. To learn more about our rental fleet or schedule your rental, you can fill out the form below or call (800) 228-5438.

In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation.</p>

A large suv or more often truck that has had longer suspension components nailed on it to increase ground clearance. A lifted suspension, though it's protected from scraping over rocks and debris, responds differently to this stress; if you lift your Jeep's suspension, your standard shocks might not do the trick.</p>
