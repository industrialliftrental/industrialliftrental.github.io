<h2>Fork Truck Safety Wausau</h2>
<p>Forklifts have come a long way since 1906, when an official of the Pennsylvania Railroad at Altoona, Pa., added storage battery power to a baggage wagon, producing what was probably the first powered platform truck. The added bonus with this machine is that it has a turning circle of just 2.5 m, compared to a standard forklift with fork extensions at 3.7 m,” says Murray.</p>
<p>The reach forklift also features low under-carriage clearance and so we recommend that, prior to purchasing, you survey when the truck would be in operation. Visit your local big-box superstore like Costco's, Sam's Club, Lowe's or Home Depot, and it's hard not to notice all those forklifts. A forklift is made out of a fork, a control unit, a motor and a counterweight.</p>
