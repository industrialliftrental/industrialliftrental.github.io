<p>Welcome to the home of Doosan Forklifts in the UK. The Forklift Trucks Market in Asia Pacific is likely to witness the highest growth in the coming years. This increases road clearance and makes the vehicle appear to be larger than stock vehicles. Dealerships generally charge extra for forklifts that are returned with damage. Whether you need low level pickers, or turret truck pickers, you'll find the machine that best fits your needs below.</p>
<p>The Herc Rental fleet is worth more than $3 billion. In other words if you are unloading pallets from racking and your top beam is at 144” you will need a lift truck that has a maximum fork height of a few inches higher to ensure you will be able to lift pallet above the rack and then remove the pallet from the racks.

Mid-Ohio Forklifts, Inc., is a full-service forklift dealer in North Central Ohio.</p>
<p>While some may know forklifts primarily as a material handling appliance, there are in fact many different categories of forklifts. For starters, Crown's OnTrac Anti-Slip Traction Control on its narrow aisle reach trucks uses the forklift's on-board control system to determine whether the truck is losing traction. This is not always a terrible thing, but it often takes some getting used to, especially if you have driven the standard model and then change to a lifted truck.</p>

One of the most important and widely used pieces of equipment in material handling, the lift truck is a powered industrial vehicle used to lift and transport materials for short distances. As you drive into a left-hand corner, the right tire will increase in weight as the vehicles weight is transferred from the centerline.</p>
