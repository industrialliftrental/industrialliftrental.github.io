<p>We have access to many brands, so we will have a Forklift solution that fits your requirements. Each of these types of lift trucks have many configurations to meet the need of your specific application.

Shifting Supplies: Whether or not your supplies are palletized, you can shift them around with a rough terrain forklift. While the dealer insures the equipment, you'll want to make sure your company's insurance covers the operator, other people at your facility and the facility in the event of an injury or property damage when the rented forklift is in use.</p>
