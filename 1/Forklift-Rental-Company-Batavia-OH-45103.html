In a stand-up forklift, most often they require the use of a joystick which can present a learning curve to some operators. Our rental lift trucks are maintained to the industry's highest standards and undergo comprehensive pre-rental inspections to ensure consistent performance and reliable operations. Also for rent, sit-down, stand-on or walk-behind forklifts.</p>
