<p>Those who operate powered forklifts must pass classroom training and a driving test before being licensed. Often a large forklift load obstructs the driver's view in one direction. According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the counterbalance load distribution are involved in falling load accidents more frequently than other types of powered industrial trucks.</p>
