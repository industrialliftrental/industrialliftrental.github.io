With a higher ride height and ground clearance, you can drive up and down steeper angles without worrying about damage to the bumpers.</p>

<p>Is a distributor of material handling equipment and warehouse solutions. Is one of the nation's largest forklift truck dealerships. Leveling Kits: The rear end of a truck naturally sits higher than the front end to compensate for heavy loads. Suitable for indoor horizontal transportation and stacking, such as in warehouses, distribution centers and logistics companies, the Toyota range of powerful reach trucks offers high acceleration and exceptional drivability for optimum pallet movement.</p>
<p>The larger ground clearance allows you to install larger tires and perhaps the best part of all is that your truck will handle the same or better than it did before depending on the type of kit you install. It may be tempting to buy one of the lifted trucks for sale in Phoenix without test driving it. But don't do it. Lifted cars can cost hundreds to thousands of dollars more So, if you are going to buy one, it's only fair that you test it out first.</p>
