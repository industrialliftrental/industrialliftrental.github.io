<p>Many truck shoppers in the Lexington, Frankfort, Winchester, and Nicholasville area know they can count on Georgetown Auto Sales to give them a great selection of trucks, lifted or not, and a fair deal with honest sales. Considerations include forklift type, capacity, carriage type, and number of hydraulic functions (that power the attachment features).
