<p>Order picking trucks have a working platform that helps the operator to control the lift. Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
<p>Four-wheel-drive is usually a selectable system designed to give better performance on broken terrain in low grip road conditions. 3-wheel lifts - used for pallet storage and other minor” tasks, this type of lift has a max load capacity of about 4,800 pounds.

<p>Lift & place 3 loads onto truck bed (75mm tolerance) and remove upon completion. Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position. This means the lift truck doesn't have to face the shelves—it can drive straight while still picking up loads to the side.</p>
