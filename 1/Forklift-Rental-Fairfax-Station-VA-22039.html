<p>Diamond now has separate websites for Equipment and Event Rentals. Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>Texas First Rentals San Antonio is your one stop for material handling equipment and forklift rental - featuring Cat telehandlers and Heli forklifts. For leaf sprung, solid-axled vehicles, pinion wedges should be installed between the axle and spring pack to compensate for the driveshaft angle by rotating the differential housing up, making for a clean pinion angle on the differential side.</p>

I appreciate the informative post and pictures you have shared of different types of forklifts.

We're here to let you know what sets lifted trucks apart from other pickups on the road - it's more than just the style and the ride height.</p>
<p>Compared to the internal combustion systems, the performance of AC trucks in parameters such as load-lift ability, ability to negotiate a ramp, acceleration, speed control on-ramps, and braking are gaining attraction of the industries. Because there is no load, the center of gravity is nearly in the center of the forklift's counterbalance. When you lift a truck or SUV, the lifting process typically involves adding new aftermarket performance parts such as brakes, shocks , bigger wheels , or tires to your truck.</p>

<p>Picking cases or single items from racks in a warehouse is the only job an order picker, a single-purpose lift truck, does. The following tests represent minimum stability requirements for order picker trucks with traction control on the lifting device, and not restrained by external means, having rated capacities up to and including 10,000 pounds at a 24 inch load center.</p>
