The handle shall be mounted in such manner that the operator will steer with his left hand when facing the load end of the truck. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Since washing a lifted truck also involves washing tires (and pretty massive ones sometimes), I would recommend using a handheld tire brush like the one pictured above for rubber sidewalls.</p>
<p>The user should mark, on the sides of the truck, in letters at least 1½ in. high, the actual vehicle weight, the maximum load and the combined weight of the vehicle and capacity load. Because the dimensions of the machine, its weight, the counterbalance, and other elements will define the nominal load that the forklift can handle and lift. An additional set of wheels allows pallet truck to be moved sideways in addition to being the conventional forward and back directions.</p>
<p>This will help determine the capacity of the forklift you need to rent. In the meantime, the global forklift industry is in the midst of robust growth, reaching all-time highs in 2016 as orders topped 1,182,000, up 7% from 2015, which set the previous record.
