The Hyster range of high, medium and low level order pickers are designed to make the order picking process as easy as possible for the operator.</p>
<p>The forklift is designed with a load limit for the forks which is decreased with fork elevation and undercutting of the load (i.e., when a load does not butt against the fork "L"). That's why many pallet trucks are barely wider than a pallet. Capable of handling heavy loads on all terrain types, Access Hire Australia's range of rough terrain forklifts are highly versatile machines.</p>
<p>These pallet trucks are designed to carry heavy loads with minimum effort. Leveling Lift Kit: This is the most affordable kind of lift kit and is best for those who just want to look bigger on the road, because they only lift the front end and don't offer a significant enhancement to off-road trail performance. To avoid accidents, the operator should always remember to stack the loads evenly across the pallet and that they are balanced.</p>

Similar to standard counterbalanced forklifts, NA and VNA lifts can support from 3,000 to 12,000 lbs and are available in a range of three or four-stage masts that offer lift heights up to 31 feet, as well as multiple chassis designs. The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>

Knowing your specific needs and what forklift type best fits your application is very important when renting equipment for your job site.</p>
