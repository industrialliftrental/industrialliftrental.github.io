<p>Industrial counterbalance forklifts are the most common trucks used in indoor warehouses and stores. Angled lower backrest provides the operator with a clear view of the fork tips, which makes it easier for the operator to insert the forks into a pallet. Rough terrain forklifts typically have rugged tyres and feature heavy-duty construction. Trucks may be of the reaching or non-reaching type, equipped with tilting mast, or forks that tilt alone without tilting mast, or without any form of mast or fork tilt.</p>
<p>Here we are talking about ways to improve your business with the help of a hand pallet truck. Safety for order-pickers who work around high-lift trucks is as important as safety for the drivers.

Considerations include forklift type, capacity, carriage type, and number of hydraulic functions (that power the attachment features).

Our forklifts are built rugged & reliable, to the strictest of quality controls according to ISO 9001, and operated in the harshest conditions around the world.</p>
<p>My "beater" 4WD has a 3" lift kit that gives it about a 10" minimum ground clearance-more than enough clearance to handle some quite nasty trails-but I actually use my 4WD for both work and pleasure in areas where such capability is a necessity. This is expected to drive the demand for warehousing, which in turn, will drive the global Pallet Trucks market in the coming years.</p>
