Year-end forklift truck sales of 260,180 included electric rider trucks (Class 1 and Class 2 combined), motorized hand trucks (Class 3) and internal combustion powered trucks (Class 4 and Class 5 combined).

<p>August 2018: Safety standard for low-end high Forklift Trucks was announced by the Industrial Truck and Standards Foundation (ITSDF), ANSI-accredited standards developing an organization. Lift trucks use either gasoline-powered engines, diesel engines, or electric motors, with the power supplied by a rechargable industrial battery. We carry new and used forklifts in every major make and model.</p>
<p>Linear speed control, an option on many competitors' trucks, is standard on all SP models and utilises a variable height sensor to measure platform height and determine the optimum speed level.
