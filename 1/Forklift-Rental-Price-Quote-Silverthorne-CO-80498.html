<p>Its key ability is that it can extend its forks beyond the compartment and reach into warehouse racks in a way that standard forklifts cannot. The usual procedure is to ensure the "drop lever" is fully depressed (pallet jack prongs fully lowered) and then give a quick, forceful pull, which will usually release the stuck pallet jack wheels in a pallet. In December 2000, Toyota Motor Corporation and Toyoda Automatic Loom Works signed an agreement to integrate their logistics and forklift businesses and transfer the business to Toyoda Automatic Loom Works.</p>

<p>Reality: the higher a heavy load is lifted, the less safe a forklift becomes. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it.
