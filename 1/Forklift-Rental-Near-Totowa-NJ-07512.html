<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? For tests requiring an elevated load, it may be more convenient to simulate a load by hanging the test load from a framework supported by the forks in the manner described in item 3. This point of suspension, of course, must be on centerline of truck and at a height above forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>
<p>In order to prevent the lift from tipping, the combined center of gravity of the load and the lift must stay inside the stability triangle (at ground level) at all times. If you are looking for good-conditioned forklifts from a reliable company, contact Ready Machinery Movers. Don't expect a forklift to handle like a car or truck. The best lift kits have fairly new if not brand new arched springs with suitable length to prevent odd shackle angles.</p>
