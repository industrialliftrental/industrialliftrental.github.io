<p>Industrial counterbalance forklifts are the most common trucks used in indoor warehouses and stores. Angled lower backrest provides the operator with a clear view of the fork tips, which makes it easier for the operator to insert the forks into a pallet.

<p>Their high capacity of up to three tons and easy manoeuvrability in tight spaces make hand pallet trucks the perfect warehouse aid. Although forklifts are fairly easy machines to operate, it is recommended that all drivers receive proper forklift training and certification. Whether you need an electric lift rental, internal combustion machine, multi-direction side loader, narrow aisle and high-density lift, rough terrain or truck and trailer mounted forklift, you can find it at our convenient Sacramento store.</p>
