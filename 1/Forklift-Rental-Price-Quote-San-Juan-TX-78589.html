Counterbalance forklifts are a traditional solution to tackle many material handling scenarios and situations. Also, aftermarket installations like a lift kit can void the warranty on a lot of vehicles - that's a lot of benefits to leave on the table.</p>
<p>It's called the HERC, one of the company's four different series of vertical-mast forklifts comprised of 12 core models. Most tires that accompany this type of machine are designed for rugged terrain and exterior use. This Raymond-exclusive feature maximizes truck speed as the platform rises, capitalizing on an area of opportunity for providing faster travel between picks compared to conventional speed control.</p>
<p>Reality: the higher a heavy load is lifted, the less safe a forklift becomes. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. By applying air pressure to the lift axle, the driver is able to add one more axle into the equation and relieve some of the weight being supported by the other axles.</p>
