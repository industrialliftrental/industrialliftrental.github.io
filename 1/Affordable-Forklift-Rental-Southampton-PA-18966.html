<p>Rough terrain forklifts are perfect for moving heavy loads across rugged terrains. Backed by our proven support network, Crown's internal combustion forklifts are ready to handle the tough assignments.

<p>As forklift operators need to sit in their machine for hours together, a high-quality adjustable seat is essential. Front suspension drop-down brackets, or a crossmember cradle, allow the vehicle's suspension pickup points to be relocated at a lower position, which allows the vehicle to be lifted without changing the suspension's travel and steering geometry.</p>

Driving a couple of inches higher won't only provide you with an improved view of the road, but your vehicle's body and lower parts will also be considerably safer from flood water and street debris.
