<p>Sometimes using a forklift for your pallet moving operation is like taking a bazooka to a knife fight.

A properly loaded lift truck does not exceed the rated capacity of the truck as listed on the trucks data plate.</p>
<p>We understand that determining the best used forklift for your specific needs is difficult. Key parts like your brakes, suspension system, and tires will need to be refreshed more often than if you drove a non-lifted truck. This is ideal if you have multiple loads in one bay that you can access from different angles, as the truck can grab loads further back.</p>
