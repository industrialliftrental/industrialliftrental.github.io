With the walking operator facing in the direction of travel, with the load trailing, clockwise movement of the steering tongue shall steer the truck clockwise. Unlike Standard Counterbalance and Reach Forklifts, These forklifts are steered via the front swivel articulation of the forklift and are therefore much different to manoeuvre than regular forklifts and additionally have no pantograph feature for retrieving stock in narrow aisles.</p>

Jcb rough terrain forklift tires work under a variety of conditions but one thing remains the same, safety is paramount.</p>
