<p>JCB rough terrain forklifts are a reliable, comfortable, versatile and easy-to-use solution for any challenging rehandling environment. Train the Trainer” is a six-hour course in which I review OSHA regulations; how to evaluate an operator's performance during a driving test; and how to properly operate and maintain forklifts in terms of their controls, attachments, maintenance, rules of the road, and so on. I charge $175 per person, but similar programs can range anywhere from $150 to $600 per person.</p>
<p>Here we are talking about ways to improve your business with the help of a hand pallet truck. Safety for order-pickers who work around high-lift trucks is as important as safety for the drivers. We manufacturer heavy duty and extra heavy duty pallets for 3.5 ton and 5 ton load handling. Gregory Poole is proud to offer the best forklift rentals selection in Virginia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.</p>
