<p>Forklift is a small industrial vehicle, having a power operated forked platform attached at the front that can be raised and lowered for insertion under a cargo to lift or move it. Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities. Our wide range includes Standard Forks (540 mm), narrow forks (450 mm) wide forks (685 mm) super wide forks (800 mm, 1000 mm) short, long & super long forks (900 mm, 1150 mm, 1220 mm, 1500 mm, 1800 mm, 2500 mm) in minimum fork heights of 36 mm, 51 mm, 75 mm & 85 mm. We offer finish such as painted, powder coated, galvanised, pallet trucks of special materials such as stainless steel.</p>
<p>There are plenty of things to consider about how your truck will change after it's lifted. A walk-behind narrow aisle lift truck with a 3,000 to 4,000 pound capacity costs approximately $15,000 to $18,000. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida.</p>
<p>A forklift that cannot tolerate the amount of weight or lift that weight to the proper height is not only a waste of time and money, but it is very dangerous. A forklift is a type of material handling lift that has two prongs attached to the front of it. These prongs look like a tuning fork and assist in the lifting of objects. The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly.</p>

The pallet jack also features a durable sealed pump with overload safety system.</p>
<p>For moving unusually heavy loads manually, BT Heavy Lifter allows for safe and efficient handling with minimal effort. With a capacity to pack them one on top of each other, our range of material handling equipment reduces the transporting time by half. Like multi-directional forklifts, sideloaders make handling long loads much easier. The factor of safety of forks shall be at least 3 to 1 based on the yield point of the material.</p>
