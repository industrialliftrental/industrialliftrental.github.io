Pallet jacks can cost less than $500 and powered hand trucks less than $3,000.</p>

Lifted cars have the potential to run right over smaller vehicles in the event of a high-speed accident. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident, because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.</p>
<p>The Mast is a vertical part that lifts up and pushes down the loads. Ausa T204H: This fork truck rental falls under the telehandler category, as it combines the lifting capacity of a forklift with the reach of a crane.

<p>Shock absorbers manage the kinetic energy that travels through your Jeep's suspension and chassis as you drive to give you a bump-free ride and keep other components from wearing out too quickly.
