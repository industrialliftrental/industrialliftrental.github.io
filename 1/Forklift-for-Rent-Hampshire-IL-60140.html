<p>Electric forklifts are much quieter than LPG or diesel forklifts.

<p>One of the main safety risks for order pickers is falling from height when exiting the cabin onto pallets, partially enclosed platforms or racking. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test OP1, or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. Knowing your specific needs and what forklift type best fits your application is very important when renting equipment for your job site.</p>

<p>Equally important is the amount of usage you will require of your forklift. Order picker forklifts can handle loads of 3,000 pounds or more. Whether you need a compact electric lift truck for your narrow aisles, a big boy 110,000 lb. lift for your quarry operation or anything in between, you can count on Altorfer Cat.

<p>Rough terrain forklift operation requires the driver to be constantly aware of the ground surface conditions in the direction of movement, and requires focused attention at every phase of the task at hand.
