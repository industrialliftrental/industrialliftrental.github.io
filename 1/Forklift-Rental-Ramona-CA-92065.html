Pallet jacks can bear a lot of weight, but they also have limits that cannot be safely exceeded.</p>

Built for demanding use, this pallet jack is constructed from all-welded steel components. If you leave a forklift unattended, lower the forks to the ground. Do not lift the heaviest load to the maximum lift or stacking height.</p>
