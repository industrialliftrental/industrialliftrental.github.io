<p>Contact us if you have more forklift accident statistics to contribute to this page. The traditional model of the forklift stability triangle is useful, but it leaves out one important thing: three-dimensional space. Stand-Up Rider = A lift truck designed to be controlled by an operator standing. But if the forklift is put in motion, or sits on a sloping surface, its center of gravity shifts.</p>
<p>Service intervals of 1,000 operating hours mean that trucks operate reliably. Whether you're using the truck to commute to work every day or planning to carve your own path offroad, choosing the right lift kit is a crucial decision. Not all kits are created equal, and a rough-riding rig can add to fatigue on long trips, make controlling the vehicle exhausting, and put wear on the truck itself.</p>
<h2>Industrial Lift Truck & Equipment Latta </h2>

Yale Materials Handling Corporation markets a full line of materials handling lift truck products and services, including electric, gas, LP-gas and diesel powered lift trucks; narrow aisle, very narrow aisle and motorized hand trucks.

<p>Electric forklifts are much quieter than LPG or diesel forklifts. A lifted truck or SUV can add style, utility and performance in a variety of situations, on and off-road, and if you're shopping for lift kits or if you've already committed to the work and extra expense it takes to put in a lift kit, you know that going the extra mile for safety and performance is just part of the deal.</p>

<p>Most of the time, using a gas forklift is absolutely fine, but it's not always ideal.

In using a straddle truck, the material is carried under the forklift and between its wheels.</p>

The smallest of the modern pneumatic style forklifts, the 3,000 lb. pneumatic is ideal for light-duty outdoor applications. The lift helps going through or over tough terrain and is especially great for off-roading and mudding enthusiasts.</p>
