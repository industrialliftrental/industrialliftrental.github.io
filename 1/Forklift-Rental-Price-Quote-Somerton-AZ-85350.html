<p>Depending on the mast height, you can lift them up to 25 feet off the ground. A reach truck is a narrow-aisle, right-angle stacking truck designed for unit load handling with rack interface. As for the right amount of lift, a 2-, 4-, or 6-inch lift kit (or more) will give you more clearance for driving off-road.
