<p>Toyota Forklift is proud to have the biggest range of forklifts and battery-electric warehouse equipment available in South-Africa, ensuring that whatever your requirements we have a suitable material handling solution. Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load at maximum elevation and at maximum rearward tilt permitted by the truck mechanism, at that elevation, shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope about an axis parallel to a line connecting the center or either load wheel tire (or outermost tire where multiple tires are used) and the projection perpendicular to the platform of the point of intersection of the longitudinal centerline of the truck and centerline of the steering wheels.</p>
<p>These forklifts are known for what their name indicates, their ability to lift loads at a high altitude. Because of these possibilities, operators should be careful to keep the center of gravity firmly within the stability triangle. Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.</p>
<p>Employers must certify that operators have received all necessary training and evaluate each operator at least once every three years. The Black Widow features a 6 inch fabtech lift kit, custom wheels wrapped with BF Goodrich all terrain tires. The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension, and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck.</p>
