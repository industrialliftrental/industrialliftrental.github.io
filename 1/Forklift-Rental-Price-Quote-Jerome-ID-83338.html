With decades of experience in the shipping industry and warehouses in general, we know a thing or two about what to look for when it comes to buying a quality pallet jack. As the forklift begins to tip, it will move slowly, tricking the operator into believing there is time to jump. To avoid accidents, maintain a safe distance from other forklifts and pedestrians when the truck is elevated.</p>
