According to Fortune Business Insights, the lift truck market is expected to reach 2,242.1 Thousand Units in 2026.</p>
<p>A forklift that cannot tolerate the amount of weight or lift that weight to the proper height is not only a waste of time and money, but it is very dangerous. A forklift is a type of material handling lift that has two prongs attached to the front of it. These prongs look like a tuning fork and assist in the lifting of objects.

<h3>Counterbalance Forklift Mars PA</h3>
<p>One of the main safety risks for order pickers is falling from height when exiting the cabin onto pallets, partially enclosed platforms or racking.

Knowing your specific needs and what forklift type best fits your application is very important when renting equipment for your job site.</p>
<p>Picking cases or single items from racks in a warehouse is the only job an order picker, a single-purpose lift truck, does.
