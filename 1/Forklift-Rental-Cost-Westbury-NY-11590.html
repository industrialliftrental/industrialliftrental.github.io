<p>Looking to rent material handling equipment in Phoenix? With an inventory featuring some of the highest quality and powerful 4x4 trucks, you're certain to get excited if you step onto Penske Chevrolet of Cerritos's car lot These trucks, converted with a standard suspension lift, big tires, and top quality safety technology, are constructed to handle work at construction sites, off-road driving or road trips.</p>
<p>While a side loader can measure less than five feet wide to fit into narrow spaces, a counterbalance forklift may need up to 13 feet to easily turn and maneuver through aisles. Your 4×4 truck can be your ticket to off-road adventures, your daily driver around town, your hauling and towing machine, or your work truck. If everything looks sound, place the pallet jack in a designed storage area, with the handle locked in a raised position.</p>
<p>Lift & place 3 loads onto truck bed (75mm tolerance) and remove upon completion. Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position. This means the lift truck doesn't have to face the shelves—it can drive straight while still picking up loads to the side.</p>
