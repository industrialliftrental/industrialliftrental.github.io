<p>The telescoping forks are equipped with hydraulic lifting systems which raise the forks or lifting platform to reach pallets and items on the high shelves or racks For intensive applications, a high strength, heavy duty mast can be used to provide support to the extra weight. Therefore, the driving experience behind the wheel of cheap used lifted trucks for sale is unlike anything else.</p>
<p>Because rough terrain vertical mast forklifts are larger and made to handle heavier loads than vertical mast counterbalanced forklifts (classes 1, 4 and 5), they require more space to operate as well as a sturdy surface that offers substantial support. They are transported on the back of a flatbed trailer or other large truck and designed for loading and unloading building materials within a range of rough terrain environments, including construction, demolition, mining, and other industrial job sites.</p>

This hybrid design gives operators the flexibility to program the truck to run on its own or operate manually as a traditional lift truck. The average lifespan of wooden pallets is approximately 3-5 years, which certainly isn't a short lifespan for a product that is constantly carrying heavy loads across the country.</p>
