Masslift Africa is the sole distributor of Mitsubishi forklifts in Southern Africa. The 8,000 lb. electric 4-wheel is used in higher capacity operations. This involves driving the pallet jack throughout the warehouse, collecting different products on the order sheet, and safely getting out of the warehouse to load the orders onto a truck or other shipping vehicle.</p>
<p>Now I have seen a few TASTEFUL trucks lifted, the person who posted the lifted Dodge Ram was nice. The Industrial Duty Pallet Jack is great for small spaces, and handles easily.

<p>With capacities ranging from 3,500-18,000 pounds, the 4-Wheel Electric Counter-Balance can be used for specialized heavy lifting applications such as machinery and tool installation.

<h2>Lifted Truck Dealers Lynwood</h2>

The C500H rough terrain forklift has the ability to move loads up to 5,000 Kg (11,000 lbs) in less than ideal applications. For one thing, any lifted truck has a higher center of gravity than it would as a standard factory model.</p>
