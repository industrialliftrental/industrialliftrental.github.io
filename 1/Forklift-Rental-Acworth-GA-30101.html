First and foremost, it is important to understand the different types of lift kits. All the Electric Pallet Trucks supplied by us are available at sensible price range and delivered on time.</p>

This is expected to drive the demand for warehousing, which in turn, will drive the global Pallet Trucks market in the coming years.</p>

The forks, supported by the two front wheels, are raised hydraulically to lift the pallet. Now, a lot of later model 4WD's do need a "mild" lift-usually less than 4"-to improve their ground clearance for serious backcountry trail work, but-again-most 4WD's never see anything rougher than a gravel road.</p>
