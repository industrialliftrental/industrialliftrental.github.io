<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Check to make sure that the pallet jack is not on the cross wood of the skid, front wheels must be on the floor. In a forklift the operator sits on a seat with a seatbelt, a steering wheel and hand controls to move the lifting mechanisms. We offer certification on the Counterbalance Forklift from the following awarding bodies: RTITB, NPORS, CPCS, LANTRA. Our OSHA experts and training specialists are standing by to help you with all your counterbalance forklift training needs.</p>
<p>In addition, lower costs of these trucks over conventional material handling equipment boosts their popularity in end-user industries. The powered pallet jack is generally moved by a throttle on the handle to move forward or in reverse and steered by swinging the handle in the intended direction. Material handling is an essential business. The 56 hp version feels underwhelming compared to some other forklifts such as the Caterpillar.</p>
