<p>Welcome to the home of Doosan Forklifts in the UK. Operating a rough terrain forklift exposes you to many hazards. For individuals who do exclusively on-road driving and no hauling, the only noticeable benefit is the lifted line of sight and boosted aesthetic. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. The first step toward buying the pre-designed lifted truck for you is to determine exactly what it is you're looking for in a vehicle of this type.</p>

We offer a wide range of Hydraulic Pallet Truck which is made from advanced quality material and sophisticated technology.

At least 22% of these deaths were caused by forklift overturns and another 20% to workers on foot being struck by the forklift.</p>

<p>One type of counterbalance forklift is the three-wheel model which provides better control when driving the truck. After all, raising a vehicle's ride height will potentially impact brake lines, steering geometry, and custom four-link systems as well. In addition to making off-roading easier, truck lifts can give you other advantages like better visibility and easier towing.</p>
<p>Not only do we offer top quality Cat, Clark and Mitsubishi forklifts that represent the latest in technology, power and innovation, but we also carry a wide variety of allied brands. Although they have been built to work in less favorable areas, great caution still is required when traveling and raising loads in such conditions to prevent tip-over, a leading cause in lift truck fatalities.</p>
<p>EE. Electrically powered units that have all the safeguards of the E and ES units, plus the electric motor and all other electrical equipment are completely enclosed. Also called "telescoping forklifts," these machines feature a boom arm that extends outward. Sometimes the outriggers on a standard walkie reach truck can get in the way of picking loads up. To get around this issue, the counterbalanced stacker has a longer chassis to increase leverage.</p>

<p>Sometimes using a forklift for your pallet moving operation is like taking a bazooka to a knife fight. Many aftermarket lift kits provide CV spacers to move the stock axle outward, effectively lengthening it, but spacers aren't necessarily the best answer for the long haul. A properly loaded lift truck does not exceed the rated capacity of the truck as listed on the trucks data plate.</p>
<p>Configurations include Sit Down Forklifts, Stand Up Reach, Pallet Jacks, Scissor Lifts and many others. This is the total amount of weight the forklift can move off the ground.
