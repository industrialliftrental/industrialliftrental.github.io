<p>Electric forklift not holding charge? Lifting capacity and weight will also vary whether it's manual or electric. Operate trucks equipped with attachments as partially loaded trucks when not handling a load. The second type is a body lift kit, which raises your truck between one and three inches and allows you to keep your standard tires while giving them a wider margin from the body. In contrast, renting a rough terrain forklift can help you keep your costs in check.</p>
<p>Displays showing the load weight and lift height provide the driver with the necessary information to transport and stack loads safely while still ensuring fast work cycles. Best of all, these GMC lifted truck modifications do not voice the warranty. The load capacity of the forklift will restrict the load capacity of the order picker cages.

<p>Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels. Almost identical to the 6,000 lb. 4-wheel, the 6,500 lb. truck has a slightly heavier counterweight. The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it. The name comes from the counterweight in the rear of the vehicle.</p>
