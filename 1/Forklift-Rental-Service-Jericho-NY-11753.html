<p>If you are driving a forklift for the first time, one crucial thing to remember is that forklifts are steered by the rear wheels, unlike most cars. Do not alter or eliminate any forklift parts or add any forklift parts or add any accessories such as additional counterweight or lifting attachments unless approved by the manufacturer in writing. Lifted trucks draw attention from everyone on the road and act as giant billboards at local shows, putting that paintjob high up in the sky for everyone to see.</p>
<p>A forklift that cannot tolerate the amount of weight or lift that weight to the proper height is not only a waste of time and money, but it is very dangerous. A forklift is a type of material handling lift that has two prongs attached to the front of it. These prongs look like a tuning fork and assist in the lifting of objects. The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly.</p>
<h2>Forklift Sales Service Parts H&H Industrial Truck Service Jericho </h2>
<p>These powered industrial trucks are known as counterbalance forklifts. Loop handle is spring loaded to return to upright position and eliminate bending to retrieve. One of the most important tests on a forklift is the American Society of Mechanical Engineers stability test. Reach trucks are often designed to work within narrow aisles and confined storage spaces, and are able to be tightly maneuvered around corners and shelves.</p>
<p>Counterbalanced forklifts are weighted at the rear to prevent the vehicle from tipping forward when lifting a load. Moving mast reach forklifts have a higher ground clearance due to larger wheels, but are unable to handle double deep racking responsibilities without a fork extension attachment. If these tests are used to determine capacity or alternate rated capacities, use appropriate loads and load centers instead of those herein specified.</p>
