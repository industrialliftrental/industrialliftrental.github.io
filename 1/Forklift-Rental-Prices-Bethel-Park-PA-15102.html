<p>Diamond now has separate websites for Equipment and Event Rentals. These electric-powered lift trucks are generally designed for sit-down operation, but standing models are also available. Reach forklifts are narrower than a typical forklift, allowing them to navigate in spaces their beefier brethren would dare not roam.

This is expected to drive the demand for warehousing, which in turn, will drive the global Pallet Trucks market in the coming years.</p>
<p>Lifted trucks have ample appeal—they provide an elevated line of sight, greater ground clearance and, most importantly, that head-turning, rugged coolness factor so many of us envy.
