<p>Diamond now has separate websites for Equipment and Event Rentals. These electric-powered lift trucks are generally designed for sit-down operation, but standing models are also available. Reach forklifts are narrower than a typical forklift, allowing them to navigate in spaces their beefier brethren would dare not roam.

Variations of order picker trucks are available and are in accordance with the application these will be used. Forklifts are not cheap, least of all the top-quality ones. But "rough terrain" isn't simply an indication of the machine's robust nature.</p>
<p>My "beater" 4WD has a 3" lift kit that gives it about a 10" minimum ground clearance-more than enough clearance to handle some quite nasty trails-but I actually use my 4WD for both work and pleasure in areas where such capability is a necessity. This is expected to drive the demand for warehousing, which in turn, will drive the global Pallet Trucks market in the coming years.</p>
<p>Lifted trucks have ample appealâ€”they provide an elevated line of sight, greater ground clearance and, most importantly, that head-turning, rugged coolness factor so many of us envy.
