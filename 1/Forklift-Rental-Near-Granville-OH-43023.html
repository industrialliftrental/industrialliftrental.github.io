<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? For tests requiring an elevated load, it may be more convenient to simulate a load by hanging the test load from a framework supported by the forks in the manner described in item 3. This point of suspension, of course, must be on centerline of truck and at a height above forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>

Additionally, if you're towing a heavy load, a lifted suspension provides the benefit of having more room to settle before the weight of the load bottoms out.</p>
<p>These trucks are required for loading and unloading the materials and carrying it from one place to another. These drivers should not forego lifted trucks, but should consider a lower height that would accomplish their goal without exceeding what is necessary. To be fair, lifted trucks are not for everyone, however, and there are some drawbacks that go along with their advantages.</p>
