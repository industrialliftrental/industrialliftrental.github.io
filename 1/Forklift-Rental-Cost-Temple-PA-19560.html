<p>Looking to rent material handling equipment in Phoenix? Furthermore, the type of the load does matter and there are specific forklift attachments that can improve a standard forklift and aid you in moving the load more resourcefully. Not work on a forklift platform unless the industrial lift truck is on a firm flat surface and the platform is equipped with guardrails or a travel restraint system or fall-arresting system.</p>
<p>Look out for any uneven surfaces that could result in technical difficulties for the stability and longevity of your reach forklift. Lifted cars have the potential to run right over smaller vehicles in the event of a high-speed accident. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident, because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.</p>
<p>Hand-pallet trucks (aka pump trucks) are non-powered tools used to move palletised loads; typically up to 5500 lbs. Powered by energy efficient AC motors, the BT Reflex R-series and E-series of reach trucks are best suited to forklift applications involving high lifting with heavy loads.
