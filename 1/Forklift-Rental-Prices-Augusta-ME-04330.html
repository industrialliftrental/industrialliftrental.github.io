<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Check to make sure that the pallet jack is not on the cross wood of the skid, front wheels must be on the floor. In a forklift the operator sits on a seat with a seatbelt, a steering wheel and hand controls to move the lifting mechanisms.
