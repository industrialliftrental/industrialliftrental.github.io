The forklift has since become an indispensable piece of equipment in manufacturing and warehousing operation.</p>
<p>With most models, you'll get two forks that allow your crew to pick up and lift all kinds of pallets. The main things you will need to consider would be the cost of purchasing forklifts to rent out, maintaining the forklifts between rentals, and also having qualified forklift repair-persons capable of doing repairs on-site.

<p>Keep an eye on your driveline after you lift your truck. The latest family of low level order picking trucks from Toyota Material Handling is the BT Optio L-series.

<p>Rentals are a repeat business - your customers only rent your equipment for a period of time, so if they need it again in the future they have to rent again.

<p>The larger ground clearance allows you to install larger tires and perhaps the best part of all is that your truck will handle the same or better than it did before depending on the type of kit you install. It may be tempting to buy one of the lifted trucks for sale in Phoenix without test driving it. But don't do it. Lifted cars can cost hundreds to thousands of dollars more So, if you are going to buy one, it's only fair that you test it out first.</p>
