Some small work zones and warehouses require a compact-sized forklift for safe maneuvering and material handling, while more demanding loads require a heavy-duty model designed for maximum lifting power or extra height.</p>

Means shall be provided for an operator on the elevatable platform to shut off the power to the truck.
