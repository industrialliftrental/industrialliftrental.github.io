<p>In digging around facts about a forklift rental company, some things you might consider are the company's service level agreements, the age and condition of their forklifts available for rent, as well as the questions they ask to rental enquiries. Our forklift rental fleet is regularly updated with new equipment and maintained according to manufacturer's specifications.</p>
<p>For pallet jacks that can weigh for dual efficiency, contact METTLER TOLEDO. We recommend this pallet jack due to its' heavy duty structure and its affordability.
