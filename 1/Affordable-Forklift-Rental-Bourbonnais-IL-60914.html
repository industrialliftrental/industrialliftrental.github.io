OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years. Technology makes today's RT forklifts safe, comfortable, and environmentally friendly.</p>

<h2>Used Reach Truck Bourbonnais</h2>
<p>For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. Forklifts have a wide range in their lift capacity, ranging from as little as 3,000 pounds to as much as 35,000 pounds or more. Fortunately, for those of us who love big trucks, there are many companies out there offering big-brake upgrade kits.</p>

<p>Remember, the operator is responsible for the safe operation of the forklift. Keep in mind that the higher you are lifting a load the lower the capacity will become.

Order pickers have a different steering control and they can turn sharper than a usual forklift.
