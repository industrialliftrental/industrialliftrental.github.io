<p>For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. Forklifts have a wide range in their lift capacity, ranging from as little as 3,000 pounds to as much as 35,000 pounds or more. Fortunately, for those of us who love big trucks, there are many companies out there offering big-brake upgrade kits.</p>
