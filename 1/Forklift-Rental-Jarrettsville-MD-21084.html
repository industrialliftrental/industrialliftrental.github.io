<p>Forklift is a small industrial vehicle, having a power operated forked platform attached at the front that can be raised and lowered for insertion under a cargo to lift or move it. Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities. If your need entails lifting loads in outdoor sites, then a rough terrain forklift may be for you. Often, this is not as easy to accomplish with the transmission or transfer case side of the driveshaft, and your U-joint-style driveshaft is best tossed for a custom unit, using a double cardan or CV joint that can run smoothly at higher angles. If you're looking for all terrain forklift for sale or forklift hire call our team on (09) 887 2523 today or enquire online for a free quote.</p>
<p>For anyone interested in some serious off-roading, lifted trucks can be a great way to take your experience to the next level and conquer all-new trails. For body lift kits you don't get additional ground clearance, but it's a good choice if you're consistently driving on highways and streets because it adds lift without sacrificing handling, steering, or ride comfort.</p>
<p>We understand that your business experiences unique circumstances and equipment needs, and our convenient rental plans are designed to match your unique circumstances. Pallet jacks may seem simple enough to use, but no employee should operate a pallet jack unless they have been trained on safe operation of the pallet jacks used in their current workplace. Forklifts, at maximum, can only travel 8 mph or 3 mph around people, but even at that speed, one of these 4-ton vehicle's steel tusks can puncture your machinery and shut down your operation.</p>
