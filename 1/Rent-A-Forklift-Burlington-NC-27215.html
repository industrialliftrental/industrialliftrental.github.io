<p>Start the forklift to both operate the mast as well as drive the forklift around. These types of powered industrial trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and have pneumatic (air filled) tires. Simply release or replenish air from the Air Lift air bags to make your ride smoother or to support a heavier load.
