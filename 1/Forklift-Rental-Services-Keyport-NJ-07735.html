Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
<p>They provide a reliable, economical material handling solution. This reflects an order intake of 109,200 forklifts (+12.5%) and 106,300 units produced (+16.6%).

Owing to the increase in the size of the wheels, you also need sizeable brakes to bring the lifted truck to a stop safely.</p>

The Black Widow features a 6 inch fabtech lift kit, custom wheels wrapped with BF Goodrich all terrain tires.

Visit your local big-box superstore like Costco's, Sam's Club, Lowe's or Home Depot, and it's hard not to notice all those forklifts. A forklift is made out of a fork, a control unit, a motor and a counterweight.</p>
