<p>Raymond's ACR System (advanced AC motor control system) delivers powerful AC drive and lift that reduces downtime and increases warehouse productivity enabling faster, smoother operation while increasing operator confidence and lowering total cost of ownership.

<p>In the past most order picking jobs were carried out on ground level to increase the productivity, while stock was replenished to the bottom layer with reach & fork trucks. Unique forklift of its category with an optional wider axels to maximize the stability at full load. Properly maintaining your truck lift kit , as well as the truck mechanical parts, will prevent wear and tear over time allowing your truck or SUV last longer.</p>
<p>Additionally, ‘Ergolift' allows the operator to raise the high-level order picker forks to a comfortable working height, whilst the position of the hydraulic forks cylinder under the floor and the split controls give unobstructed access to the collecting pallet. There's a wide variety of styles and designs available, some capable of moving loads of 5000lbs, but the main difference is between the lift and pallet trucks.</p>

<p>Long Term Forklift Rental includes all fair wear and tear items and repairs over the life of the agreement, which avoids unscheduled out of pocket expenses. Having an order picker licence and forklift licence combined is a huge advantage when looking for work in the warehouse industry. Now that is an awesome start to a lifted truck, having an underbody that is rust free and ready to go. No rusty fuel lines, brake lines, gas tanks, axles or rotors all this matters.</p>
<p>Most forklift rentals give general training for handling the rented equipment. In addition to this, the industrial counterbalance forklift offers straightforward operation. A rental forklift is often the best option when the need for the lift truck is mostly seasonal. Providing a standup platform rather than a seat allows for the reach truck's shortened length giving it its "tight access" capability.</p>
<p>Pinch point hazards are also common when operating this type of forklift truck. It is your environment that invariably determines which type of pallet trucks you should buy.
