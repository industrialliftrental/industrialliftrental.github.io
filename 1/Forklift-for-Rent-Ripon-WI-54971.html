<p>If you are driving a forklift for the first time, one crucial thing to remember is that forklifts are steered by the rear wheels, unlike most cars. Do not alter or eliminate any forklift parts or add any forklift parts or add any accessories such as additional counterweight or lifting attachments unless approved by the manufacturer in writing. Lifted trucks draw attention from everyone on the road and act as giant billboards at local shows, putting that paintjob high up in the sky for everyone to see.</p>

You'll need hangars, four-links, airbags, and custom driveline equipment once you start going so big, just don't forget the ladder. Our counterbalanced fork trucks are ideal for operations that require breakdown of pallets removed from trailers, long runs to P&D stations, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>It is important to note; however, that electric forklifts have a limited run cycle, usually 4 - 6 hours and are less capable of lifting loads greater than 15,000 pounds.

Manufacturers of industrial trucks make a widespread contribution throughout the U.S. economy.</p>

Having a lifted truck also helps you see traffic jams early on so that you can take the necessary steps to avoid them if necessary. The process of transforming a regular truck into a lifted truck is going to take a lot of thought, a lot of parts, and some very specific equipment in order to do it safely, correctly, and legally — but the results can be pretty impressive.</p>
