<p>Browse Forklifts Equipment. A electric hand pallet truck is one of the most commonly used lift trucks in industrial companies. Since the forklift carries the load out in front of the vehicle, there are counterweights in the back of the forklift. Rather than installing between the body and frame, these kits are used to physically increase the height of the suspension for the pickup, which raises the body and frame.</p>
