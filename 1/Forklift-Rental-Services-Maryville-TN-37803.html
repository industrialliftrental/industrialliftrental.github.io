<p>Choose from corrosion-resistant pallet jacks for demanding environments, or all-terrain jacks for navigating various types of ground surfaces. Using the procedure outlined for the test, an empty truck with the forks elevated 12 inches from the test platform measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified in Graph D, Curve 1.</p>
