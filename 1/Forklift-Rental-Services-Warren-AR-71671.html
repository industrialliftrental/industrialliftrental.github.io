Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that a line connecting the center of either load wheel tire (or outermost tire where multiple tires are used) and the projection perpendicular to the platform of the point of intersection of the longitudinal centerline of the truck and the centerline of the steering wheels is parallel to the axis of tilting of the platform.</p>

<p>Roll Pallet Trucks are suitable for handling paper reels, textile rolls, polymer reels, carpets and other rolls. One forklift may be a better investment than the other based on a warehouse's assets, budget, and daily operations. Driving a lifted truck makes you feel like king of the road. Simplify your workflow when picking orders by attaching the TAWI Mobile Order Picker to any kind of forklift or pallet jack.</p>
<p>The rise in lifting heights also increases the specific requirements of forklift drivers, who have to deal with greater mast oscillation and restricted vision.

The PTH Series hand pallet jack features solid construction and generous use of steel - especially at critical stress points - to deliver for long-lasting performance.</p>
<p>Lifted trucks have ample appealâ€”they provide an elevated line of sight, greater ground clearance and, most importantly, that head-turning, rugged coolness factor so many of us envy.
