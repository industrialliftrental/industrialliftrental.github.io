Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that a line connecting the center of either load-wheel tire (or outermost tire where multiple tires are used) and the projection perpendicular to the platform of the point of intersection of the longitudinal centerline of the truck and the centerline of the steering wheels is parallel to the axis of the tilting of the platform, and with the steering wheel nearest the tilting axis parallel to the axis.</p>

The United Academy provides a broad range of training and certification across all equipment use and handling skills. For example, a hydraulic skate is not the same as a counterbalanced tricycle, although both are classified as forklifts. In industry sectors where robust and versatile equipment is required, two materials handling options - telehandlers and rough-terrain forklifts - stand out.</p>

If you are allowed to test drive some lifted trucks alone, you may need to bring in documents like copies of your driver's license.
