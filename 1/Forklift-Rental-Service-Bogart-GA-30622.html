While most standard forklifts can reach between 10 and 15 feet, a telehandler can lift to heights of 55 feet.</p>

A forklift is a type of material handling lift that has two prongs attached to the front of it. These prongs look like a tuning fork and assist in the lifting of objects. The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly.</p>
