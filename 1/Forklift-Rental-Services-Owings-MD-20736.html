<p>Diamond now has separate websites for Equipment and Event Rentals. Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it.

That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>

Lifted cars have the potential to run right over smaller vehicles in the event of a high-speed accident. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident, because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.</p>
