<p>They will also learn to carry out pre-shift safety inspections, to load and unload pallets as required and to identify the causes of instability in the truck and loads. This type of rough terrain forklift is vehicle-mounted and fitted with a telescopic boom lift, which allows this machine to pick up and transport loads at various distances and heights.

The counterbalance forklift is a popular lift that features forks in the front and a weight in the back of the vehicle to counterbalance the weight of the load.</p>
