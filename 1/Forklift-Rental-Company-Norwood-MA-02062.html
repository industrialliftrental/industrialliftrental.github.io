<p>Texas First Rentals will remain open during the COVID-19 outbreak to safely serve customers across our territory. That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>
<p>Options and accessories available for this type of forklifts include a rail guidance, load-facing operator controls, a retractable tether, and an auto-locking pallet clamp. Every year nearly 100 workers are killed and 20,000 are seriously injured in forklift mishaps. Designed to work specifically indoors in tight access environments like high density warehousing, standup forklifts offer a number of efficiency enhancing features that are not available on the "general use" standard sit-down forklift.</p>

<p>Rentals are a repeat business - your customers only rent your equipment for a period of time, so if they need it again in the future they have to rent again. A forklift that cannot tolerate the amount of weight to the proper height is not only a waste of time and money, but very dangerous. Learn more about the benefits of a long-term equipment rental and whether it's a good choice for your company.</p>
<p>This version is known as a deep-reach lift truck. The most common type of forklift has a heavy counterweight over the rear tires to balance the load. Standard counterbalance forklifts require aisles of approximately 13 ft wide to effectively turn, navigate, and move pallets. All operators are required to wear a harness while operating any order picker at any height.</p>

Unless you're starting a rental business because you won the lottery and got bored, you'll want to make the most of every cent or penny you spend.</p>
