<p>Texas First Rentals will remain open during the COVID-19 outbreak to safely serve customers across our territory. That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>

<p>Rentals are a repeat business - your customers only rent your equipment for a period of time, so if they need it again in the future they have to rent again.

Learn more about the benefits of a long-term equipment rental and whether it's a good choice for your company.</p>
<p>This version is known as a deep-reach lift truck. The most common type of forklift has a heavy counterweight over the rear tires to balance the load. Standard counterbalance forklifts require aisles of approximately 13 ft wide to effectively turn, navigate, and move pallets. All operators are required to wear a harness while operating any order picker at any height.</p>
