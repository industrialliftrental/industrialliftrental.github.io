Bucket trucks can offer aerial lifts that range from 34 to over 100 feet. You might notice less suspension damping during long trips and on rough, uneven roads, but this only tends to be an issue if you're lifting your truck more than a few inches.</p>

Front suspension drop-down brackets, or a crossmember cradle, allow the vehicle's suspension pickup points to be relocated at a lower position, which allows the vehicle to be lifted without changing the suspension's travel and steering geometry.</p>
<p>Be sure the load is centered and the forks are completely under the load before lifting. It can lift a 4,000 ft payload up to 21 ft in the air.
