That piece of equipment is known as the pallet jack It is possibly one of the most versatile, durable and useful pieces of material handling equipment available. A double mast forklift has a second mast attached to the carriage of the first mast.</p>
<p>Most forklifts have a three-point suspension system. For all their benefits to the modern workplace, forklifts bring with them numerous hazards. Before you even pick up a pallet, the jack has a base weight that should be factored into any maximum weight restrictions for certain surfaces, such as lift gates or container floors. From moving products on and off trucks, to storing them in a warehouse, it takes a lot of energy.</p>
<p>If you are a forklift operator, be sure to fasten your seat belt before moving the equipment. The Mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets weighing 3,000 - 6,000lbs. Distribution centers, warehouses, stock yards, construction companies all have a use for this popular forklift type. The maximum height with respect to the maximum weight - If a forklift can lift a maximum weight of 2.5 tons and has a lift height of up to five metres, it might not be able to lift 2.5 tons up five metres.</p>
