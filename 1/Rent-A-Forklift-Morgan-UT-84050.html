<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? For tests requiring an elevated load, it may be more convenient to simulate a load by hanging the test load from a framework supported by the forks in the manner described in item 3. This point of suspension, of course, must be on centerline of truck and at a height above forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>
<p>It was fun driving different types of sit down forklifts. Side Loader forklifts have been popular in the past as they were the first forklift designed specifically for long load handling.

<p>Service intervals of 1,000 operating hours mean that trucks operate reliably. Whether you're using the truck to commute to work every day or planning to carve your own path offroad, choosing the right lift kit is a crucial decision.
