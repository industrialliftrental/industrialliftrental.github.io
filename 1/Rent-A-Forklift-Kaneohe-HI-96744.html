<p>We've performed many lifted truck services and we are proud of the work we've done. Keep all parts of your body inside the industrial lift truck when travelling; travel with the forks as low to the floor as possible; decrease speed around corners and sound the horn; and, travel in reverse when a load obstructs your vision. You shouldn't ever buy forklifts that haven't had a Thorough Examinations test done, and you shouldn't purchase from a forklift sales dealer who doesn't know the ins and outs of lifting equipment.</p>
<p>Service intervals of 1,000 operating hours mean that trucks operate reliably. Whether you're using the truck to commute to work every day or planning to carve your own path offroad, choosing the right lift kit is a crucial decision. Not all kits are created equal, and a rough-riding rig can add to fatigue on long trips, make controlling the vehicle exhausting, and put wear on the truck itself.</p>

Newer vehicles sporting the latest in electronics often have a Vehicle Speed Sensor (VSS) which uses electronic sensors to tell the truck's computer how fast the truck is moving.</p>
<p>Just like with tires, wheels are also rated to carry a load, and most ratings max out at a specific tire size. There are many good advantages of hiring material handling equipment.
