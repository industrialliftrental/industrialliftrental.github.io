Rent diesel or LP-gas forklift or rent a specialized material handling forklift, such as a truck-mounted forklift or piggyback truck. At CatÂ® Lift Trucks we design and build counterbalance forklift trucks for every application.

With our used forklifts, we can offer up to 36 months on a $1 buyout lease option. Yale has been manufacturing materials handling equipment for over 140 years.
