<p>Diamond now has separate websites for Equipment and Event Rentals. Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>Reach trucks aren't meant for moving loads long distances. If you're unable to find a pre-made lifted truck in your area, or if these vehicles are too expensive for your budget, you may have more luck modifying a truck yourself. The Forklift Order Picker Cages have durable wire mesh backs and side panels and are to be used in conjunction with a body harness (for working at heights).</p>
<p>A truck lifted with a 2.5-inch coil spacer. With the test load elevated to maximum height, and for trucks with tilting up 4 rights without change in the original overhang dimensions, the test platform shall be tipped to the specified slope. In order to purchase the right counterbalanced truck for your warehouse or construction site, it's critical to buy a machine that will support the average load size you expect to lift.</p>
