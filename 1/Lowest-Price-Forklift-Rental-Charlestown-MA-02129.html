<p>Gas forklifts constantly need to be refilled, so the recurring need to purchase fuel makes the long-term costs hefty. Forklifts vary in size, ranging from one ton capacity for general warehouse related work to 50 ton capacity for shipping container work. Whereas the standard order pickers have fixed forks that can only be driven in or out of the pallet, the swing-reach's forks can approach pallets from a variety of positions.</p>
<p>It may be necessary to travel long distances with the load to the rear in reverse for most forklifts. There are two main types of side loader forklifts, the enclosed cab that is most commonly used outdoors, and a stand up version that is more suited to indoor tasks. Remember that the price of the equipment isn't the only cost you'll incur if you purchase a forklift.</p>
