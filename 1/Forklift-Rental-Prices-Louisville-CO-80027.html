<p>Diamond now has separate websites for Equipment and Event Rentals. Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it.

The heavy-duty models that can lift big loads have an even larger fork shaft and double wheels at the front.</p>
<p>We'll show you some of the common problems associated with lifted trucks and throw a few solutions your way so you can determine if living with a towering four-wheeled high-rise is for you. Built for demanding use, this pallet jack is constructed from all-welded steel components. If you leave a forklift unattended, lower the forks to the ground. Do not lift the heaviest load to the maximum lift or stacking height.</p>
