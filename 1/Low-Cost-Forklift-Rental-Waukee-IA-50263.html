Whether working within the tight quarters of a semi trailer, stacking loads on the dock or handling put-away and retrieval within warehouse racks, the SC Series provides operators with the capability and confidence needed to position loads with precision.</p>
<p>Compared to the internal combustion systems, the performance of AC trucks in parameters such as load-lift ability, ability to negotiate a ramp, acceleration, speed control on-ramps, and braking are gaining attraction of the industries. Because there is no load, the center of gravity is nearly in the center of the forklift's counterbalance. When you lift a truck or SUV, the lifting process typically involves adding new aftermarket performance parts such as brakes, shocks , bigger wheels , or tires to your truck.</p>

<p>Forklifts also come in different sizes and models. Rough terrain forklifts are used at industrial sites where uneven surfaces can exist. The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck. If other tests or tests for trucks over 10,000 lb rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parries.</p>
