<p>Diamond now has separate websites for Equipment and Event Rentals. Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>To replace hydraulic pallet truck when under 300kg load.Pallet are simply lifted by pulling the handle backward, more efficient. Using the add-a-leaf will increase the height, but sometimes makes the suspension ride rough because of the added spring rate. Experience working in a warehouse or factory will be a bonus when applying for jobs as a forklift truck driver.</p>
<p>This internal transport equipment makes loading and unloading more efficiently, which results in a more productive working day. The 3,500 lb. forklift uses the same body style as the 3,000 lb. The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight, which gives the extra 500 lb. capacity. We offer lifted trucks across a variety of models and trim levels, so no matter if you're shopping for a baseline full-size pickup or an upgraded heavy duty model, you can secure whichever you need with a lifted upgrade.</p>

<p>Ground clearance same as cushion tire forklift. Yes, it's going to be harder to get in and out of your truck, but a twisted ankle or scraped knee is a small price to pay compared to a truck body rocketing off of its suspension due to some shoddy craftsmanship. When you are finished with the rental it is a good idea to properly clean the forklift. The most obvious benefit is the increased ground clearance when driving over rugged terrain, which reduces the risk of damage to your undercarriage.</p>
