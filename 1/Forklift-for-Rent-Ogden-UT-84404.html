<p>Inside, vehicle-specific valving and a nitrogen-charged monotube body work together to provide a smooth ride, even with oversized tires. Forks that are meant to carry the load are attached to the main body of the forklift by a pair of roller chain pulleys whose fulcrum forms a gear at the top of the mast. Jcb rough terrain forklift tires work under a variety of conditions but one thing remains the same, safety is paramount.</p>
<p>Counterbalanced forklifts are weighted at the rear to prevent the vehicle from tipping forward when lifting a load. Moving mast reach forklifts have a higher ground clearance due to larger wheels, but are unable to handle double deep racking responsibilities without a fork extension attachment. If these tests are used to determine capacity or alternate rated capacities, use appropriate loads and load centers instead of those herein specified.</p>
