<p>Lift Code 4: Three Wheel Electric Trucks, Sit Down. 3. 3 Acknowledgment OSHA's Office of Training and Education wishes to acknowledge the following for contributing some of the graphics used in this presentation:  Caterpillar Lift Trucks  Mason Contractors Association of America  Industrial Truck Association  State of Utah Labor Commission - Occupational Safety & Health Division  Steamship Trade Association of Baltimore  Taylor Machine Works, Inc.</p>
<p>Gradability = The maximum percent of a slope a lift truck can negotiate with a capacity load.

For example, a hydraulic skate is not the same as a counterbalanced tricycle, although both are classified as forklifts. In industry sectors where robust and versatile equipment is required, two materials handling options - telehandlers and rough-terrain forklifts - stand out.</p>
<p>The Mast is a vertical part that lifts up and pushes down the loads. Ausa T204H: This fork truck rental falls under the telehandler category, as it combines the lifting capacity of a forklift with the reach of a crane. Forklift operators must beaware of the necessary forklift safety practices for each classification and certified on each class of forklift to operate it.</p>

Using the procedure outlined for this test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which horizontal travel with unrestricted turning is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified in Graph D. Curve 1.</p>
<p>Whether you need to buy or rent a stand-up or sit-down forklift, Tynan Equipment Co. is here to help. Not only is the distance between the frame and body widened, but the leaf springs are recreated to actually lift the entire suspension.
