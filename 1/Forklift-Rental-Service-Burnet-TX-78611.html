Our Rental Purchase Option (RPO) provides customers with an opportunity to acquire equipment by building equity over the rental period.

Another place where pallet trucks are very useful and can often be found is in loading docks.</p>
<p>OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,” below).
