<p>While moving palletized loads is fastest and easiest, these machines can load and unload a variety of objects. Our Rental Purchase Option (RPO) provides customers with an opportunity to acquire equipment by building equity over the rental period. Growing industrialization is anticipated to drive the demand for pallet trucks, especially from non-traditional industries in growing economies in Asia Pacific.</p>
<p>It is good practice to keep the load back against the truck mast as much as possible. If you're looking specifically for Toyota forklifts, this is where you need to look.

<p>This type of lift is more expensive than a body lift and requires making changes to the mechanical system or suspension of the truck. REACH TRUCK: A self-loading truck, generally high-lift, having load-engaging means mounted so it can be extended forwardly under control to permit a load to be picked up and deposited in the extended position and transported in the retracted position (Fig.</p>
<p>If you are a Private Individual looking to obtain a CPCS card for a Rough Terrain Forklift, the implications are very different from those of a CITB registered construction company. These lifts allow you to add beefier off-road tires and heavier suspension components but do come at a higher cost. Another place where pallet trucks are very useful and can often be found is in loading docks.</p>
<p>OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,‚Äù below).
