<p>Forklift is a small industrial vehicle, having a power operated forked platform attached at the front that can be raised and lowered for insertion under a cargo to lift or move it. Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities. If your need entails lifting loads in outdoor sites, then a rough terrain forklift may be for you. Often, this is not as easy to accomplish with the transmission or transfer case side of the driveshaft, and your U-joint-style driveshaft is best tossed for a custom unit, using a double cardan or CV joint that can run smoothly at higher angles. If you're looking for all terrain forklift for sale or forklift hire call our team on (09) 887 2523 today or enquire online for a free quote.</p>

Because of these possibilities, operators should be careful to keep the center of gravity firmly within the stability triangle. Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.</p>
