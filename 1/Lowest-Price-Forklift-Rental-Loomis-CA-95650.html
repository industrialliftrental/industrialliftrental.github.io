<p>Electric forklift not holding charge? Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.). The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>
<p>While moving palletized loads is fastest and easiest, these machines can load and unload a variety of objects. Our Rental Purchase Option (RPO) provides customers with an opportunity to acquire equipment by building equity over the rental period. Growing industrialization is anticipated to drive the demand for pallet trucks, especially from non-traditional industries in growing economies in Asia Pacific.</p>
