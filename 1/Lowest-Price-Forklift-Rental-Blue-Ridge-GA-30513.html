The traditional model of the forklift stability triangle is useful, but it leaves out one important thing: three-dimensional space. Stand-Up Rider = A lift truck designed to be controlled by an operator standing. But if the forklift is put in motion, or sits on a sloping surface, its center of gravity shifts.</p>
<p>Powered by lead-acid batteries or, increasingly, lithium-ion batteries , include: cushion tire forklifts, scissor lifts, order pickers, stackers, reach trucks and pallet jacks. Trucks are pushing such boundaries with lift kits these days that it's almost getting ridiculous to see guys actually climb into them.

<p>Picking out the right lift kit height means you'll need to know a little bit more about how certain lift heights will affect your vehicle's performance and what they are generally used for. Load Capacity or Rated Operating Capacity refers to how much weight the pallet jack can safely lift. Motorized hand trucks must enter elevator or other confined areas with load end forward.</p>

<p>The reach forklift also features low under-carriage clearance and so we recommend that, prior to purchasing, you survey when the truck would be in operation. Visit your local big-box superstore like Costco's, Sam's Club, Lowe's or Home Depot, and it's hard not to notice all those forklifts. A forklift is made out of a fork, a control unit, a motor and a counterweight.</p>
