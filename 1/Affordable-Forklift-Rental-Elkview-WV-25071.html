It offers quick acceleration and fast lift speeds to keep your operators moving. Warehouses and shop storerooms can operate with more complexity than ever before, and with our collection of fine order pickers for sale, the sky is quite literally the limit.

Suspension lift kits can raise a truck a full foot from where it started, and they aren't just lifting up the truck's body and putting it back again.</p>
<p>This is achieved by two outer legs which distribute the load weight and prevent the forklift from tipping. OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years.
