Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>

<p>Linear speed control, an option on many competitors' trucks, is standard on all SP models and utilises a variable height sensor to measure platform height and determine the optimum speed level. Therefore, a truck's suspension has to be lifted and its components adjusted so everything fits and works well. Skilled forklift operators annually compete in obstacle and timed challenges at regional forklift rodeos.</p>

Four fixed-fork order pickers are ideally suited for picking bulky, oversized items or where extended platforms and industrial carts are used in place of pallets. If you need the forklift to operate under a fixed height structure, such as a container door then you should also consider the collapsed height of the mast.</p>

Narrow aisle forklifts like walkie stackers and side loaders can measure less than 5 ft. However, if you are using a forklift in a warehouse setting, it is important to consider the aisle width.</p>
