<p>There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front. Turret Trucks are battery operated machines that use both the electric engine, battery and operator compartment to counterweigh heavy loads. Safety on and off the road is the foremost issue concerning all lifted vehicles.</p>
