<p>A parking mechanism shall be provided and capable of holding the truck on the maximum grade which the truck can negotiate with rated capacity load, or on a 15 percent grade, whichever is the lesser. Larger tires and wheels have much more mass that will need stronger and larger brakes in order to allow the vehicle to safely come to a complete stop.
