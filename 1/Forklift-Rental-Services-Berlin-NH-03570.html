<h2>The Importance Of Having A Reach Truck Or Forklift in Berlin </h2>
<p>Our company has a variety of finance options available on our forklifts for sale to simplify the process for you and get you back to work quickly. The rough-terrain or straight-mast forklift has become more of a niche machine, rather than an ‘everybody-needs-one' machine,” says Charlie Detrich, U.S. sales & dealer development manager for Liftking. Heubel Shaw's large rental fleet includes Reach trucks, Stand up forklifts, sitdown 4-wheel and 3-wheel forklifts, order pickers and pallet jacks.</p>

Body lift kits also allow the owner to keep the factory suspension installed and don't require any significant alterations to your truck's shape.

<p>Whether or not you know you want to commit to a lifted truck, Chevy has you covered with some of the best options around for going off-road in a pickup. AUSA rough terrain forklifts are exceptionally compact, powerful and versatile. Thanks to their high capacity of up to three tons and excellent manoeuvrability in even the tightest of spaces, hand pallet trucks represent ideal warehouse aids.</p>
<p>Most rough terrain forklifts have ergonomic controls for easy, intuitive use. Forklift capacities often range from 3,000 - 7,000 lbs, meaning you can load at least 1,600 lbs on your pallet with the order picker. However, for a warehouse with narrow aisles, having a maneuverable forklift capable of reaching in excess of ten meters makes the reach truck a considerable adversary in the right conditions.</p>
<p>Custom-length CV axles are also a better bet for any lift kit, especially those that offer increased wheel travel over stock, and recommend that spacers should be used in conjunction with stock axles. Whether a complete beginner or an experienced operator, our range of forklift training benefits individuals or employees wanting to develop their skills.

We have forklift hire & rental available for periods as short as a couple of hours and as long as up to five years. Rent a Heli warehouse forklift with a 5000 lb load capacity.
