<p>Industrial counterbalance forklifts are the most common trucks used in indoor warehouses and stores. Angled lower backrest provides the operator with a clear view of the fork tips, which makes it easier for the operator to insert the forks into a pallet. Rough terrain forklifts typically have rugged tyres and feature heavy-duty construction. Trucks may be of the reaching or non-reaching type, equipped with tilting mast, or forks that tilt alone without tilting mast, or without any form of mast or fork tilt.</p>

<h3>Top Forklift Manufacturers Richmond KY</h3>
<p>Available in electric and LPG varieties, turret trucks reportedly increase storage space up to 31% by enabling optimal space efficiency between stacks. Typically, order pickers are given a list of products to retrieve from a warehouse. The cost for a typical IC forklift is also much less than its electric counterpart upfront, but costs more over time due to fuel costs.</p>
<p>We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions. When placed on the forks, the center of mass of the test weight should be located on the longitudinal centerline of the truck.</p>
<p>Even with a solid 4% job growth for forklift operators expected between 2018 and 2028 , robotic forklifts are set to take over. You can avoid these charges by utilizing your own LP Gas tanks or filling up the fuel tanks prior to returning the rental equipment.
