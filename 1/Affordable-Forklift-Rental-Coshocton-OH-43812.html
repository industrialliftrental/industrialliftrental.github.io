<p>Double-deep trucks are similar, but with longer forks, making them perfect for areas where multiple pallet loads are stored in each bay as they will reach right to the back of the bay.

The Toyota Forklifts website is owned by the Toyota company, and is the definitive resource for renting quality approved equipment. Most models of order pickers are electric powered and its battery is used as part of the counterbalance.</p>
<p>Forklifts have different shapes and sizes, also meet different and varied purposes. The hand pallet or lift truck has wheels located under the fork and uses a hydraulic jack for lifting and moving the pallets. These attachments, and the ability to extend the lifting capabilities with front outriggers, enable the tele-handler to complete work at heights that normal forklifts can't reach.</p>
