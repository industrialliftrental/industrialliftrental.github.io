<p>Body lifts will essentially lift the body of the truck from the frame, insert spacers on the frame, and reattach the body to the frame.

<p>With a standard side shift of 3" in either direction and the optional power positioning forks, operators can precisely place their loads. De-ration or reducing the forklift's nominal capacity can help get the figures right. An order picker is an appropriate lift truck for any operation that deals with many SKUs and not a lot of quantity of any particular SKU number.</p>
