<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. 2WD rough terrain forklift has strong flexibility with 100% differential lock; 4WD rough terrain forklift adopts traditional technology while imported key components: DANA integrated trans-axle, Sauer Danfoss hydrostatic system, tilting cabin; 4WD compact rough terrain forklift palented self-designed axle &transmission, compact size meet with European standard.</p>

<p>A forklift that cannot tolerate the amount of weight or lift that weight to the proper height is not only a waste of time and money, but it is very dangerous. A forklift is a type of material handling lift that has two prongs attached to the front of it. These prongs look like a tuning fork and assist in the lifting of objects. The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly.</p>

<p>The two main methods for lifting a truck are by doing a suspension lift or a body lift. So this is not the same type of lift as a body lift kit. Toyota Forklifts has introduced three new order pickers. Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers. What you need to do: Take a practical test where the forklift is driven around a suitable course and the operator will be required to move and stack various loads, the test will also include one to one verbal questioning.</p>
