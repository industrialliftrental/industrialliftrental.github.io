<p>Depends on the pallet jack type and capacity. The reach truck typically works as part of a material-handling system where two requirements are equally important: cube utilization (ratio of occupied space to total cubic space available, usually expressed as a percentage) and selectivity (amount or percentage of product in a warehouse which is accessible to the aisle for picking).</p>
<h3>Forklift Uses Edna TX</h3>
<p>If you want as much ground clearance as possible and a bold lifted look, equipping your truck with both a suspension lift kit and a body lift kit is a great option. Collision hazards are a big concern for counterbalance forklifts. OSHA estimates that 110,000 forklift accidents take place every year at U.S. jobsites.
