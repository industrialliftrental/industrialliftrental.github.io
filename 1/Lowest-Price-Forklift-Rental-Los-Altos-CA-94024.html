<p>The desire to own the biggest, baddest, shiniest forklift fresh off the assembly line is understandable. Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that a line connecting the center of either load wheel tire (or outermost tire where multiple tires are used) and the projection perpendicular to the platform of the point of intersection of the longitudinal centerline of the truck and the centerline of the steering wheels is parallel to the axis of tilting of the platform.</p>

According to the Industrial Truck Association (ITA) , this represented a 2.8% increase over 2017, with steady growth seen across most lift truck classes. After running the forklift, open the engine compartment and check for any leaks, dirt buildup or cracks on hoses.</p>
<p>When renting forklifts these points will help ensure your rental experience is safe, cost effective, and gets the job done.
