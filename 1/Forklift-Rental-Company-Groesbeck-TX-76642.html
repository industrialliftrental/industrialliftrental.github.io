<p>In addition, lower costs of these trucks over conventional material handling equipment boosts their popularity in end-user industries. The powered pallet jack is generally moved by a throttle on the handle to move forward or in reverse and steered by swinging the handle in the intended direction.

Load-reach management devices can automatically restrict the reach of the forklift based on the load being handled rather than relying on the operator.</p>
