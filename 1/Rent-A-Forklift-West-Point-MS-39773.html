<p>This version is known as a deep-reach lift truck. The most common type of forklift has a heavy counterweight over the rear tires to balance the load. Standard counterbalance forklifts require aisles of approximately 13 ft wide to effectively turn, navigate, and move pallets. All operators are required to wear a harness while operating any order picker at any height.</p>
<p>Telescopic forks - hydraulic attachments that allow the operator to operate in warehouse design for "double-deep stacking", which means that two pallet shelves are placed behind each other without any aisle between them. Attachments can be used with forklifts to make the work easier and add additional functions. SFS's Hand Pallet truck can also be used for carrying small non palletised loads with suitable improvisation to hold the load on the forks.</p>
<p>Reality: the higher a heavy load is lifted, the less safe a forklift becomes. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. By applying air pressure to the lift axle, the driver is able to add one more axle into the equation and relieve some of the weight being supported by the other axles.</p>
