<p>Electric forklift not holding charge? Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.). The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>

<h2>Reach Truck Kennewick</h2>
<p>With our electric reach trucks, you will enjoy a number of technical and ergonomic benefits. The operator essentially is lifted or lowered to the stock position with the load in order to get access to the product. This means there is approximately a 35% reduction in the turning circle of the forklift, making the reach forklift far more maneuverable than the standard counterbalance forklift.</p>
<p>Counterbalanced forklifts are the most commonly used equipment in virtually all material handling capabilities. You can also trade in a rental forklift for a newer model with little hassle. Turret trucks or Swing-Reach® can work in aisles as narrow as 60”, and are used for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights. If your facility loads pallets weighing less than a ton and stack relatively low, you probably know that, and this article is preaching to the choir.</p>

Whether you are looking for a manual, semi-electric or fully electric pallet truck, you can find them all at TVH. The answers are also important for you to choose the correct forklift attachments to do the job at hand. Choose the correct shock absorbers based on which end or ends of the vehicle you're working on. Keep in mind that some trucks use struts on the front and shock absorbers on the rear.</p>
