<p>Remember, the operator is responsible for the safe operation of the forklift. Keep in mind that the higher you are lifting a load the lower the capacity will become. No forklift operator can predict every possible event. Use high-quality assembly from industry's mature suppliers to ensure the function of the truck's power system and its stability. Our Forklift Order Picker Cages assist in warehouse applications where goods are packed and picked at elevated heights.</p>

Allowing operators to tow palletised or non-palletised loads, our towing tractors are suitable for indoor and outdoor applications, including production lines, cross-dock logistics, airports, railway stations and ports.

<p>We tailor rental agreements to deliver the equipment needed for the length of time that it is needed. Most rough terrain forklifts within this range are run by a single joystick that controls all boom functions and hydraulics for simple and efficient operation. These forklifts also run on diesel engines, which make them efficient to operate. Spacing: The process of putting most trafficked goods in different aisles for less congestion of order pickers and better optimization of travel - the most costly factor of order picking.</p>
