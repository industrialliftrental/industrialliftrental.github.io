Our Train the Trainer program allows your in-house employees to become a certified counterbalance forklift trainer.</p>

That's why many pallet trucks are barely wider than a pallet.

<p>These types of forklifts are all hand controlled where the operator is in the front of the truck and controls the lift truck through a steering tiller. Driving with the load downhill can result in loss of the load and control of the forklift. At our GMC dealership near Rocky Mount and Goldsboro in Wilson, we offer professional upgraded lifted GMC trucks. You can also choose to fit the electric reach trucks with cabins for outdoor usage.</p>
<p>Sometimes an attachment has more features than your forklift has hydraulic functions and one or more need to be added. You would have to determine whether or not you are operating on a ramp, how heavy the load is, the kind of condition the pallet truck is in, and the distance you have to cover. You will also be taught the general safety rules, proper inspection criteria and how to safely fuel your forklift.</p>
