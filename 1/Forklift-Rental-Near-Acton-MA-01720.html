<p>The design of this forklift is that it has a fork and mast like those of pallet trucks Their dual forks that lift and transport loads are found at the front of the truck. Manufacturers have models of rough terrain forklifts with load capacities ranging from 4000 to 10000 lbs. For the same loadcapacity, forklifts differ in 3 main ways.

<p>Do not tow or push railway cars or trucks with a forklift. 35 inches or bigger is the common size range for determining whether or not a truck is truly a lifted truck. Add on a 6-inch lift kit and 35-inch tires on 20-inch wheels, and it's simply massive. An alternative to class 3s, tuggers can pull large loads without requiring the equipment to lift it off the ground to do it. This class is used on high traffic sites such as airport landing strips and luggage collection as they are easier to maneuver than a full forklift.</p>
