<p>To eliminate the chance of combustion, all electrical components in an explosion-proof forklift are completely sealed. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Rough terrain forklifts are designed for two things: lifting and moving loads.</p>
