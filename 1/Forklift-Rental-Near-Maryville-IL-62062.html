<p>Sometimes using a forklift for your pallet moving operation is like taking a bazooka to a knife fight. Many aftermarket lift kits provide CV spacers to move the stock axle outward, effectively lengthening it, but spacers aren't necessarily the best answer for the long haul. A properly loaded lift truck does not exceed the rated capacity of the truck as listed on the trucks data plate.</p>
<p>Reality: the higher a heavy load is lifted, the less safe a forklift becomes. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. By applying air pressure to the lift axle, the driver is able to add one more axle into the equation and relieve some of the weight being supported by the other axles.</p>
