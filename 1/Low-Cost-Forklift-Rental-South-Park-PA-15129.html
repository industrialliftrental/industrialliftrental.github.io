That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>
<p>While a side loader can measure less than five feet wide to fit into narrow spaces, a counterbalance forklift may need up to 13 feet to easily turn and maneuver through aisles.
