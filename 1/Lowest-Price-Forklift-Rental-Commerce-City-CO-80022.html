Reach forklifts are narrower than a typical forklift, allowing them to navigate in spaces their beefier brethren would dare not roam. These models have a bigger lift shaft and an increased tyre size on the front end to carry heavier loads.</p>
<p>These forklifts are known for what their name indicates, their ability to lift loads at a high altitude. Because of these possibilities, operators should be careful to keep the center of gravity firmly within the stability triangle. Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.</p>
<p>Service intervals of 1,000 operating hours mean that trucks operate reliably. Whether you're using the truck to commute to work every day or planning to carve your own path offroad, choosing the right lift kit is a crucial decision.
