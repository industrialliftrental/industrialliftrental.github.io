<p>While moving palletized loads is fastest and easiest, these machines can load and unload a variety of objects. Our Rental Purchase Option (RPO) provides customers with an opportunity to acquire equipment by building equity over the rental period. Growing industrialization is anticipated to drive the demand for pallet trucks, especially from non-traditional industries in growing economies in Asia Pacific.</p>

You can drive off our lot with peace of mind knowing we use only the highest quality name brand parts, off-road accessories, wheels and tires. Most warehouse forklift types can carry 5,000 lbs, though heavy-duty models can manage even heavier loads.

<p>Forklifts are designed to lessen the load for you. Pallet jacks offer sturdy steel construction and often feature cushion grip handles for comfort. If other tests of tests for trucks over 20,000 lb rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parties.
