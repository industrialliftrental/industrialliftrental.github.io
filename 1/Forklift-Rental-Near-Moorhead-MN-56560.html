<p>While lift kits can certainly increase utility, function and style for many truck owners, there are a few safety issues to consider first. Industrial lift truck is defined in regulation as: a self-propelled vehicle used to carry, lift, stack, tier, push or pull material. Like most other lifts, a counterbalance forklift has a pair of forks in front of the vehicle.</p>
<p>When it is necessary to omit the overhead guard, special attention should be given by the user and operator to conditions such as height and stability of loads and stacks, weight of individual units, and operating space including overhead obstructions. A forklift can overturn sideways if the center of gravity leaves the stability triangle on either of the two sides.</p>
