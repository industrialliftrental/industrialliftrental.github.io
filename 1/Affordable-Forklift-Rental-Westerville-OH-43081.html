Body lift kits are typically constructed from plastic or polyurethane with a height of around 1 to 3 inches. The forks are the most visible parts of any rough terrain forklift.

Pump trucks are primarily used as a pallet jack but do not use any electric power to lift any materials. This motor does the work of lifting the load and moving the hand truck. This is among a very good quality pallet truck with great durability and support.</p>
<p>When in doubt, ask an expert in the forklift rental industry for advice. Using the procedure outlined for the test, an empty truck with the forks elevated to the maximum height at which horizontal travel is permitted and for the travel speed allowable at that height, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified in Graph D, Curve 1.</p>

<p>One of the main safety risks for order pickers is falling from height when exiting the cabin onto pallets, partially enclosed platforms or racking.
