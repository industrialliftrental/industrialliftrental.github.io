<p>A counterbalance forklift is a popular option for a warehouse that needs heavy loads in tight situations where maneuvering is necessary. We'll bring the forklift lift truck to you, and pick it up when you're done.

Forklift attachments, such as barrel clamps, fork extensions, rotators and personnel cages are covered under a separate unit standard (US10852).</p>
