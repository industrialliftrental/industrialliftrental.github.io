Reach forklifts are narrower than a typical forklift, allowing them to navigate in spaces their beefier brethren would dare not roam. These models have a bigger lift shaft and an increased tyre size on the front end to carry heavier loads.</p>

Repair or replacement - if your forklift breaks down at any time, we will repair or replace it normally within 2 to 3 hours, depending on your location.</p>
