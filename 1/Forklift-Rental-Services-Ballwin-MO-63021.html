Drivers of counterbalance forklift trucks are responsible for transporting goods and materials. We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. These are nice Crown order picker lift trucks with low hours and in good working order.</p>
<p>That's why it's nice to rent a forklift when required. Our company also offers a range of pallet trucks. Pallet trucks are the efficient and simple mode of transporting palletized loads on the shop floor. According to the Industrial Truck Association (ITA) , this represented a 2.8% increase over 2017, with steady growth seen across most lift truck classes.

There are also leveling kits that can be applied to a pickup, which raises just the front end of the truck so that it is level with the rear. This heavy-duty multidirectional reach truck is AC driven with clear-view masts, 360° steering and sideways battery exchange for optimized productivity.</p>
<p>Having legs for stability and carrying heavy electric batteries negates the need for a counterbalance weight and enables the reach forklift to maintain a more compact body. Pallet jacks are cheap, small in size, and good for small loads. Renting a forklift affects your bottom line a lot less than purchasing one, at least over a short period of time. Our nationwide dealer network has a broad range of lift truck models available for immediate rental.</p>

<p>If you are a forklift operator, be sure to fasten your seat belt before moving the equipment. The Mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets weighing 3,000 - 6,000lbs. Distribution centers, warehouses, stock yards, construction companies all have a use for this popular forklift type.
