<p>All forklifts are rated for loads at a specified maximum weight capacity. The 12,000 lb. electric is built on a larger frame than the 8,000 to 10,000 lb. trucks. For some businesses, hiring or renting forklifts makes more sense than buying it outright. In addition to a massive inventory and excellent customer service, United Rentals prides itself on over 100 locations in Canada.</p>
<p>As forklift operators need to sit in their machine for hours together, a high-quality adjustable seat is essential. Front suspension drop-down brackets, or a crossmember cradle, allow the vehicle's suspension pickup points to be relocated at a lower position, which allows the vehicle to be lifted without changing the suspension's travel and steering geometry.</p>
