<p>Diamond now has separate websites for Equipment and Event Rentals. These electric-powered lift trucks are generally designed for sit-down operation, but standing models are also available. Reach forklifts are narrower than a typical forklift, allowing them to navigate in spaces their beefier brethren would dare not roam. These models have a bigger lift shaft and an increased tyre size on the front end to carry heavier loads.</p>
<p>You can find a range of other new and used equipment in our inventory, which makes Thompson Lift Truck your one-stop shop whenever you need equipment. To learn more about our rental fleet or schedule your rental, you can fill out the form below or call (800) 228-5438.
