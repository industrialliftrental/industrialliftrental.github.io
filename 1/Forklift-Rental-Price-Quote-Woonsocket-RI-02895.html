A lifted truck is any truck that has a high suspension system that can accommodate larger tires.</p>

The following tests are designed to verify rated capacities of counterbalanced trucks having rated capacities up to and including 20,000 lb at 24 inches load center and to determine capacity or alternate rated capacity.</p>

<p>Based on region, the global pallet truck market can be segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, and South America.

Lencrow Forklifts has a range of new electric-powered order pickers to suit each operator style and handling application.</p>
<p>These powered industrial trucks includes reach and deep (or double) reach lift trucks as well as order selector trucks (also known as order pickers or cherry pickers).

<p>While standard forklifts require aisles that are at least eleven feet wide to operate, a narrow aisle (NA) forklift can work in spaces that are 8 to 10 feet wide, while very narrow aisle forklifts (VNA) can operate in aisles as narrow as 6 feet. The presence of rough terrain forklifts on jobsites has become much more common over the last decade.
