Class six forklifts can utilize either internal combustion engines for outdoor use or battery powered electric motors for indoor use.

<p>Also known as tuggers or tow tractors, Class VI forklifts are designed to tow loads. Features range from machines with open platforms to full cabs with air conditioning. We provide a support unit if we require the repair forklift more than 24 hours. Both of these trucks feature a 2-inch factory lift, so you do not have to worry about warranty issues with an aftermarket installation, and an Autotrac 2-speed transfer case.</p>

<p>Hyster forklifts are built tough, with cutting-edge technology and innovative designs. Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. Often, a driver will raise the axle to enable the vehicle to turn easier and not have to drag the lift axle sideways through a turn.</p>
<p>Standard Hand Hydraulic High Lift Pallet Truck is fabricated using fine grade raw materials and advanced technology. Keep in mind that body lifting can only raise vehicles from 1 to 3 inches total, which means you cannot get a huge lift from these kits. Always start the engine while seated in the operator's position—never while standing alongside the forklift.</p>
