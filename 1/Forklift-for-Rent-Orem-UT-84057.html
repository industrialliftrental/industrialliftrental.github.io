Both available in two- and four-wheel-drive, the 6,000-pound-capacity RT706J and 8,000-pound-capacity RT708J models utilize an 80-hp John Deere 4045 diesel engine. Straddle trucks have longer forks than stand-up trucks and are used to carry long materials such as pipes, boards, and trees.</p>

High-level order pickers enable an operator to pick cases or items from 20 feet to 35 feet. Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
<p>Furniture picking has a very specific order picker that includes a larger platform for more ease and productivity when moving bulky and odd-sized loads. Lift kits are designed to raise your vehicle up without affecting how it rides at all. For trucks with tilting forks, the forks should be horizontal or at full upward till, whichever is less stable.
