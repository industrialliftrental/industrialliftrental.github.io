Each type of powered industrial truck presents different operating hazards. Pallet jacks are manufactured in a range of sizes, power options and lift capacity. We offer forklift sales and rentals that include everything from pallet stackers to reach trucks.</p>
<p>We understand that your business experiences unique circumstances and equipment needs, and our convenient rental plans are designed to match your unique circumstances. Pallet jacks may seem simple enough to use, but no employee should operate a pallet jack unless they have been trained on safe operation of the pallet jacks used in their current workplace. Forklifts, at maximum, can only travel 8 mph or 3 mph around people, but even at that speed, one of these 4-ton vehicle's steel tusks can puncture your machinery and shut down your operation.</p>

<p>Not to be confused with standard lift trucks, straight mast forklifts are essentially a cross between a forklift and an RTV.

The lifted suspension helps your truck better handle the rough nature of going off-road, plus the higher ground clearance means you won't bottom out as often.</p>

Make sure that the lifted truck has modified brakes with larger than normal rotors and calipers that are capable of stopping the truck in a reasonable distance.</p>
