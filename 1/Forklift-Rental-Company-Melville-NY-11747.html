<p>The order picker operator stands on a platform and moves up with the mast, unlike most lift trucks. By decreasing the air pressure, the driver can decrease the weight-carrying capacity of the axle or eliminate it completely by raising it up and off of the road. This is very important to the safety of the forklift operator. All parts are stainless including hydraulic pump, fork frame, handle, push rod, bearing, pin and bolt, etc.</p>
<p>Masts are built based on the lifting height provided and can be: double, with two telescopic bodies that extend when lifting begins; double with full free lifting, in which, unlike for the previous type, the telescopic mast does not extend until the fork has been completely raised; and triple, with three telescopic bodies.
