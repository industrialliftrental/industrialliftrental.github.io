<p>A truck that has had its suspension modified so that it rides way too far off the ground, usually to the point where the high center of gravity could actually be dangerous. Electric forklifts produce zero emissions. Better ground clearance than Pneumatic Tire forklift. Deduct this weight from your forklift's capacity and you know how much you can safely load on your pallet. First off, as you might expect, lifting a truck is a fairly complex procedure. On the other hand, there are order picker trucks that have forks that are fixed in front of the platform and thus cannot be moved.</p>

We're New Zealand market leader in large container handling equipment, and especially in the refurbishment and sale of forklift machines. The choice to lift your truck or not is ultimately going to come down to what you use the vehicle for and what you hope to get out of lifting it. If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
<p>The wheels on most lifted trucks are quite a bit larger than those on standard-sized trucks. Most forklift dealerships rent their forklifts on daily, weekly and monthly contracts. Our quality and reputation for reliability make our forklifts ideal for rentals, short or long term. Our firm specializes in offering an excellent range of Hulk Hydraulic Hand Pallet Truck.</p>
