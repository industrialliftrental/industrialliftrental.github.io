We offer competitive prices for all of our rental services, and several different tool rental rate options for your convenience. If you need large containers or heavy materials moved on such a site, you'll need the powerful engine and large tractor wheels of an all-terrain forklift. Dimensioning devices - fork truck-mounted dimensioning systems provide dimensions for the cargo to facilitate truck trailer space utilization and to support warehouse automation systems.</p>
<p>Now I have seen a few TASTEFUL trucks lifted, the person who posted the lifted Dodge Ram was nice. The Industrial Duty Pallet Jack is great for small spaces, and handles easily. Look for a forklift provider whose rental fleet is new, clean and well-maintained; one who assures you that, if there should ever be a problem, they are staffed with certified field technicians to conduct emergency on-site repairs.</p>
<p>Mariotti, maker of some of the smallest forklifts on the market, has options that are ideal for tight spaces and unusual applications (need to get through a small doorway or into an elevator?) or weight-sensitive work spaces like an old factory.

<p>Their upfront price is the inverse of electric, making IC forklifts initially cheaper than electric models, but they cost more per hour to run. Forklifts are most often used in the warehouses. However, it does suggest that people without previous experience driving a lifted truck should test-drive one of a similar height before lifting their own. Newer vehicles sporting the latest in electronics often have a Vehicle Speed Sensor (VSS) which uses electronic sensors to tell the truck's computer how fast the truck is moving.</p>
<p>As well as a number of different lift heights and capacity classes, our reach truck range also includes models for varying ground conditions. The most important things to know when you choose a forklift are its size, lift and load capacity, and configuration.

The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight that gives the extra 500 lb. capacity to the truck. Sunbelt Rentals offers a variety of forklift equipment for any type of project.
