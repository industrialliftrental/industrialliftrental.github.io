<p>Now I have seen a few TASTEFUL trucks lifted, the person who posted the lifted Dodge Ram was nice. The Industrial Duty Pallet Jack is great for small spaces, and handles easily.

The handle shall be mounted in such manner that the operator will steer with his left hand when facing the load end of the truck. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Since washing a lifted truck also involves washing tires (and pretty massive ones sometimes), I would recommend using a handheld tire brush like the one pictured above for rubber sidewalls.</p>
