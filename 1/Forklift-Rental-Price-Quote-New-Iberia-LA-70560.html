Electric forklifts produce zero emissions. Better ground clearance than Pneumatic Tire forklift.

Designed to work in narrow aisles, the electric reach stacker can tilt both forwards and backwards for safer load handling. A body lift does not increase the clearance by a huge amount, other than by allowing for bigger tires that can help raise the underside.</p>
<p>In the past this job was done with either ladders, a dangerous and ineffective solution, or with reach trucks with goods on pallets and blocked aisles. The lifting forks rise up to 31.5 inches, which saves the operator unnecessary bending and heavy lifting and increases efficiency in repetitive handling operations.

<p>This version is known as a deep-reach lift truck. The most common type of forklift has a heavy counterweight over the rear tires to balance the load. Standard counterbalance forklifts require aisles of approximately 13 ft wide to effectively turn, navigate, and move pallets. All operators are required to wear a harness while operating any order picker at any height.</p>
<p>Rent a forklift with a configuration that makes you most productive. Therefore, a fork lift operator must be able to use the machine to fit large, heavy pallets into relatively small areas, such as large shelving fixtures. When comparing between electric and gas-fueled forklift types, the choice comes down to a warehouse's needs. Their line of forklifts is predictably robust and reliable.</p>
<p>In 1958, the first four-wheel drive rough terrain forklift was introduced. Counterbalance forklifts are just one of several types of forklifts found in today's workplaces.
