Using the procedure outlined for these tests, a truck shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 14 per cent slope for loaded truck (Test #N5), and a 14 percent or 18 percent slope for unloaded truck (Test #N5A), depending on whether the truck has single rear-wheel drive (or brake) or dual rear-wheel drive (or brakes), respectively.</p>
<p>Options and accessories available for this type of forklifts include a rail guidance, load-facing operator controls, a retractable tether, and an auto-locking pallet clamp. Every year nearly 100 workers are killed and 20,000 are seriously injured in forklift mishaps. Designed to work specifically indoors in tight access environments like high density warehousing, standup forklifts offer a number of efficiency enhancing features that are not available on the "general use" standard sit-down forklift.</p>
<p>The main safety concern pertains to the lifted vehicle's bumper height from the ground. In addition to this, reach forklifts can be fitted with a camera that shows the driver what is happening above their head on a video screen. But palletisation really enhances the material handling efficiency and throughput. Rough terrain forklifts are larger, stronger and more durable and hence they are pricey than the average forklift.</p>

<p>The dual path is perfect for that driver who carries more weight on one side of their truck than the other. The higher its height limit is, the higher the price will probably be. Bucket trucks can offer aerial lifts that range from 34 to over 100 feet.
