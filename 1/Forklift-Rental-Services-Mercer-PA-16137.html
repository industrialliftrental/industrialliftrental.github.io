<p>Electric forklift not holding charge? Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.). The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Crown introduced a new 2-stage TL mast , commonly referred to as a Truckers Mast,” for its Crown FC 5200 Series counterbalance forklifts and the pneumatic and cushion tire models of the Crown C-5 Series industrial forklifts. Some small work zones and warehouses require a compact-sized forklift for safe maneuvering and material handling, while more demanding loads require a heavy-duty model designed for maximum lifting power or extra height.</p>
<p>Standard forklifts generally measure between 4 to 7 ft wide and 8 to 10 ft long. Counterbalance forklifts are available in 4-wheel and 3-wheel configuration. Predicting how many lift trucks you're going to need on any given day is difficult to do. To help you adapt to the ever-changing demands of your business, we have the largest fleet of short- or long-term rental trucks available, in-stock and ready for delivery.</p>
<h2>Get Heavy Duty Hand Pallet Truck At Best Price! Mercer </h2>

Take a closer look at the most important features to find out how rough terrain forklifts get the job done.</p>
<p>The rise in lifting heights also increases the specific requirements of forklift drivers, who have to deal with greater mast oscillation and restricted vision. Once this itemized list of goods (for example, a grocery order for a local store) is collected - usually on a motorized pallet jack - the order picker gets the pallet(s) ready for loading onto a truck.</p>
