<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Check to make sure that the pallet jack is not on the cross wood of the skid, front wheels must be on the floor. In a forklift the operator sits on a seat with a seatbelt, a steering wheel and hand controls to move the lifting mechanisms. We offer certification on the Counterbalance Forklift from the following awarding bodies: RTITB, NPORS, CPCS, LANTRA. Our OSHA experts and training specialists are standing by to help you with all your counterbalance forklift training needs.</p>
<p>Options and accessories available for this type of forklifts include a rail guidance, load-facing operator controls, a retractable tether, and an auto-locking pallet clamp. Every year nearly 100 workers are killed and 20,000 are seriously injured in forklift mishaps. Designed to work specifically indoors in tight access environments like high density warehousing, standup forklifts offer a number of efficiency enhancing features that are not available on the "general use" standard sit-down forklift.</p>
<p>Standard forklifts generally measure between 4 to 7 ft wide and 8 to 10 ft long. Counterbalance forklifts are available in 4-wheel and 3-wheel configuration. Predicting how many lift trucks you're going to need on any given day is difficult to do. To help you adapt to the ever-changing demands of your business, we have the largest fleet of short- or long-term rental trucks available, in-stock and ready for delivery.</p>
