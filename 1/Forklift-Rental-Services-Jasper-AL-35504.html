You can drive off our lot with peace of mind knowing we use only the highest quality name brand parts, off-road accessories, wheels and tires. Most warehouse forklift types can carry 5,000 lbs, though heavy-duty models can manage even heavier loads.

Reach forklifts, also known as reach trucks, get their names from the distinctive way in which their fork carriages can ‘reach' into racking.</p>

We'll bring the forklift lift truck to you, and pick it up when you're done. The type of load also matters as there are specific forklift attachments that can enhance a standard forklift and help you move the load more efficiently.</p>
<p>Forklift Trucks have a significant and higher share across the food and beverage industry.
