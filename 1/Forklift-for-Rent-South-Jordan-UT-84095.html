<p>If you imagine all three points connected into a triangle, this is the forklift's stability triangle. A large suv or more often truck that has had longer suspension components nailed on it to increase ground clearance. A lifted suspension, though it's protected from scraping over rocks and debris, responds differently to this stress; if you lift your Jeep's suspension, your standard shocks might not do the trick.</p>
