<p>The desire to own the biggest, baddest, shiniest forklift fresh off the assembly line is understandable. Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that a line connecting the center of either load wheel tire (or outermost tire where multiple tires are used) and the projection perpendicular to the platform of the point of intersection of the longitudinal centerline of the truck and the centerline of the steering wheels is parallel to the axis of tilting of the platform.</p>

<p>Flexibility is perhaps the greatest benefit to renting a forklift versus buying. Polyurethane tires are incompatible with outdoor terrain and are therefore only installed on electric lifts that are used on smooth interior pavements and loading pads.

Invest in a quality kit from a reputable manufacturer and work with an experienced mechanic to ensure that your lifted truck provides optimal performance both on and off the road.

<p>AUSA Rough Terrain Forklifts are highly versatile machines capable of handling heavy loads and big volumes on rough and sloping terrain. You've seen the big ol' monster trucks on TV, laying waste to everything they drive over. Knowing your required lift height is equally important and will affect your unit's load-carrying capacity. The pallet jack is the little brother to the forklift Generally the heavier a pallet jack is, the more weight it can handle on its rated operating capacity.</p>
<p>Most of the time, using a gas forklift is absolutely fine, but it's not always ideal. More than a quarter-million forklifts were sold in North America last year, up nearly 3 percent over 2017 and marking the fourth straight year of record growth in the industry, the Industrial Truck Association (ITA) reported this month.

This hybrid design gives operators the flexibility to program the truck to run on its own or operate manually as a traditional lift truck.
