<p>If you imagine all three points connected into a triangle, this is the forklift's stability triangle. A large suv or more often truck that has had longer suspension components nailed on it to increase ground clearance. A lifted suspension, though it's protected from scraping over rocks and debris, responds differently to this stress; if you lift your Jeep's suspension, your standard shocks might not do the trick.</p>

<p>Hyster forklifts are built tough, with cutting-edge technology and innovative designs. Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. Often, a driver will raise the axle to enable the vehicle to turn easier and not have to drag the lift axle sideways through a turn.</p>
<p>Reality: the higher a heavy load is lifted, the less safe a forklift becomes. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. By applying air pressure to the lift axle, the driver is able to add one more axle into the equation and relieve some of the weight being supported by the other axles.</p>
