<p>Diamond now has separate websites for Equipment and Event Rentals. Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>When ordering or reordering forks, make sure you are getting high quality forks that will do your lifting jobs safely. Let us help you find the perfect buyer for your forklift. If you've ever wondered why some drivers lift their trucks, you're in the right place. With the test load elevated to the maximum height for the limit of travel speed without change in the original load overhang dimensions, the test platform should be tilted to the specified slope in Graph C.</p>
<p>These trucks were hand operated, could only lift the goods 5 to 7 centimeters off the ground, and since they required a lot of manual effort from the operator, could only move the goods about a single meter laterally. Forklift Sales Botswana started over 15 years ago, when we took on the TOYOTA Forklift Dealer, and since then we have a current, estimated 80% share of the Botswana Forklift Market.</p>

Whether working within the tight quarters of a semi trailer, stacking loads on the dock or handling put-away and retrieval within warehouse racks, the SC Series provides operators with the capability and confidence needed to position loads with precision.</p>
<p>This means that they are perfect for transporting heavy loads across rugged terrain, with some models handling up to 3 tonnes per load. Buying a vehicle that has already been lifted will save the buyer the cost of the hardware, plus the labor charges of installing the lift kit. ICE trucks are available in several fuel types such as LP Gas, Diesel, Gasoline and CNG (Compressed Natural Gas).</p>

<p>Telescopic forks - hydraulic attachments that allow the operator to operate in warehouse design for "double-deep stacking", which means that two pallet shelves are placed behind each other without any aisle between them.
