Reaping those benefits, however, requires an array of skills and knowledge to operate these vehicles responsibly on siteâ€”skills and knowledge that have to be validated, either by third-party safety trainers, like myself, or by individuals who have attended training-the-trainer-type classes (more on this below), or by the vendors renting the equipment.</p>
