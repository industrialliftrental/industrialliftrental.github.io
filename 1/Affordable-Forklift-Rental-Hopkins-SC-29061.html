<p>We are offering Premium quality Heavy & Medium Load capacity hydraulic Hand Pallet truck. Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>
<p>The Herc Rental fleet is worth more than $3 billion. In other words if you are unloading pallets from racking and your top beam is at 144” you will need a lift truck that has a maximum fork height of a few inches higher to ensure you will be able to lift pallet above the rack and then remove the pallet from the racks.

<p>3-wheel forklifts are typically more maneuverable than 4-wheel machines. Courtesy Chevrolet does our lifted trucks in house so you know you are getting a great deal and a quality job done.
