<p>Diamond now has separate websites for Equipment and Event Rentals. Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>The forks should be elevated until the point of intersection of the two carrying surfaces of the forks is elevated 12 inches from the rest platform to the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks. Knowing what types of lifts are installed in vehicles and identifying which one will serve you best will make your buying experience a pleasant one.</p>
<p>These trucks were hand operated, could only lift the goods 5 to 7 centimeters off the ground, and since they required a lot of manual effort from the operator, could only move the goods about a single meter laterally. Forklift Sales Botswana started over 15 years ago, when we took on the TOYOTA Forklift Dealer, and since then we have a current, estimated 80% share of the Botswana Forklift Market.</p>

A forklift is any mechanical device, powered by an electric motor or internal combustion engine that is used to move or lift loads.</p>
<p>Fewer Responsibilities: With the purchase of a service or maintenance plan, if anything does go wrong with the leased forklift, the dealer will take care of it. Its width also ensures that the forklift truck has better stability for extra safety and lateral loading. The unit is compatible with all types of forklifts so that you can easily move within your facilities.</p>
<p>A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features. This perk makes rough terrain forklifts ideal for busy construction sites with limited space.
