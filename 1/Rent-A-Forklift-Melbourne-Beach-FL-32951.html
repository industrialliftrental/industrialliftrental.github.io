<p>If you are driving a forklift for the first time, one crucial thing to remember is that forklifts are steered by the rear wheels, unlike most cars. Do not alter or eliminate any forklift parts or add any forklift parts or add any accessories such as additional counterweight or lifting attachments unless approved by the manufacturer in writing. Lifted trucks draw attention from everyone on the road and act as giant billboards at local shows, putting that paintjob high up in the sky for everyone to see.</p>

<p>That's because standing forklifts allow the operator to help move stock on and off the lift, and move around easily to navigate the tops of racks and mezzanines. And mud tires are important if you like to hit the trail after the rain and make a mess in your lifted truck. We employ highly trained, certified technicians at all of our 94 locations to service and maintain all of our rental equipment to the highest standards, either in our own workshops or on the job-site.</p>

<p>When the operator is done with pallet jack, he or she shouldn't leave the equipment just sitting out anywhere. All types of dockboards should have a high friction surface, designed to prevent employees or trucks from slipping.

Founded in 1987 as a sales and service provider for materials handling equipment, Lift West Limited is now part of the Dunstall Holdings Group.</p>
<p>Their upfront price is the inverse of electric, making IC forklifts initially cheaper than electric models, but they cost more per hour to run. Forklifts are most often used in the warehouses. However, it does suggest that people without previous experience driving a lifted truck should test-drive one of a similar height before lifting their own. Newer vehicles sporting the latest in electronics often have a Vehicle Speed Sensor (VSS) which uses electronic sensors to tell the truck's computer how fast the truck is moving.</p>
