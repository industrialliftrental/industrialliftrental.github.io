<p>Rentals are a repeat business - your customers only rent your equipment for a period of time, so if they need it again in the future they have to rent again. A forklift that cannot tolerate the amount of weight to the proper height is not only a waste of time and money, but very dangerous. Learn more about the benefits of a long-term equipment rental and whether it's a good choice for your company.</p>
<p>Observe forklift operators in their daily work and take prompt corrective action to correct careless or unsafe operations. This is best if you have a large warehouse or need different types of lifts for the jobs you'll be doing. In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. We have a large selection of forklift parts for brands like Toyota, Clark, Hyster, Yale and more.</p>
<p>The higher ride height also leaves a space cushion so anything underneath the truck doesn't get smashed on rocks. Lift Capacity: 12000 lbs. Our clients can avail from us a gamut of Heavy Duty Pallet Truckthat when raised, locks itself to the floor with the help of extended outriggers that is complemented with a long wheel base that helps in stabilizing the truck.</p>

Controls (including remote) shall be provided which will de-activate travel controls when the operator leaves the truck.
