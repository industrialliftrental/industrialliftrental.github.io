<p>If you own your own machinery, our team of qualified mechanics will ensure that your material handling equipment is reliable and in safe working order. All pedestrian operated trucks have forks that slide beneath the pallet and use a hydraulic jack to lift the load from the ground for easy manoeuvrability. If your company has an accident or injury with a forklift, OSHA will investigate and request training records.</p>
<p>The additional height means your truck is more likely to flip and rollover in the event of a roadway emergency that involves tight handling. The hours of operation are more important than the year model when it comes to buying used forklifts. The purpose of a lift axle is to place the vehicle's total weight over a broader area, thereby allowing the vehicle to meet weight-imposed restrictions on certain roads.</p>
<p>Our rentals have the flexibility for daily, weekly or monthly rentals and allow you flexibility in your material handling needs. There are a lot of great reasons why you would want to rent a forklift versus buying one new. Class VI forklifts are sit-down rider, tow tractor lifts.
