<p>The arm allows the operator flexibility in picking up and placing loads (at various distances and lift heights) from the front of the machine. Also known as a straight mast forklift, the rough terrain forklift is designed specifically for outdoor job sites, especially on uneven surfaces. Be sure to find out what kind of warranty exists on the forklift. However, the term rough terrain” does not imply that the forklift can be safely operated on every conceivable type of terrain.</p>

One of the most popular adjustments to trucks is the lift kit - moving the entire truck higher in the air by changing out suspension parts. Pole attachments - in some locations, such as carpet warehouses, a long metal pole is used instead of forks to lift carpet rolls.</p>
