It's not always in the budget to make capital investments like buying new or used forklifts for your material handling operations.

<p>When it is necessary to omit the overhead guard, special attention should be given by the user and operator to conditions such as height and stability of loads and stacks, weight of individual units, and operating space including overhead obstructions.
