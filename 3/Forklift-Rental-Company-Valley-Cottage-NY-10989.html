<p>The telescoping forks are equipped with hydraulic lifting systems which raise the forks or lifting platform to reach pallets and items on the high shelves or racks For intensive applications, a high strength, heavy duty mast can be used to provide support to the extra weight. Therefore, the driving experience behind the wheel of cheap used lifted trucks for sale is unlike anything else.</p>
