Our Rental Purchase Option (RPO) provides customers with an opportunity to acquire equipment by building equity over the rental period. Growing industrialization is anticipated to drive the demand for pallet trucks, especially from non-traditional industries in growing economies in Asia Pacific.</p>

A rough terrain forklift can cost anywhere from $24,000 to $375,000 - a pricey investment on either end of the spectrum.</p>
<h2>Lifted Trucks Eden</h2>
<p>This is an efficient way of picking less than pallet load shipments, and is popular for use in large distribution centers. Eliminate your parts and service departments - If you currently own your fleet and maintain it you need mechanics, tools and parts. The spacious cab and adjustable controls offer the operator great comfort, even at height. But with lift kits, the danger is a little different.</p>

Suitable for heavy-duty applications, our multidirectional reach truck is capable of handling both conventional pallets and long loads, such as steel beams and plastic pipes.</p>
<p>These manual pallet jacks are ideal for special applications. 55. 55 Rule: Employees will not place any part of their bodies outside the running lines of an industrial truck or between mast uprights or other parts of the truck where shear or crushing hazards exist.

You can learn to operate the Construction Lift (Class 7 ), or add Warehouse Lift (Class 1,4,5) , Reach Lift (Class 2), Order Picker (Class 2) or Walkie-Rider (Class 3) lifts for an additional charge.</p>
