<p>This course is designed to provide experienced operators with relevant knowledge and understanding of practical use of the Industrial Counterbalance Forklift. In the Guru, when referring to overall width for class 2 & 3 trucks, overall width refers to the width of the power unit, not the outriggers. Specifically, adding such a large lift kit or monstrous wheels and tires can make daily driving around the city a real chore. No matter what size or capacity you need, you can find a rough terrain forklift for the job.</p>
<p>The average car bumper height is approximately 20 inches lower than the average lifted truck or SUV. Our flexible hire options are designed to suit your business needs and our experienced staff can help you find exactly the right solution, whether it's a lift truck for the day or a forklift for six months to five years, with full maintenance included. For more information on lift kits, contact us at Sour Lake Ford in Sour Lake, TX. We're here to make customizing your Ford truck as easy and painless as possible.</p>
<p>We also rent out electric forklift batteries and battery chargers to eliminate your forklift downtime.

<p>As well as a number of different lift heights and capacity classes, our reach truck range also includes models for varying ground conditions. The most important things to know when you choose a forklift are its size, lift and load capacity, and configuration. Exclusive, spin-off hubs allow the outer tires to be removed to drive the machine through a standard door opening.</p>
