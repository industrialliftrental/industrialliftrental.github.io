<p>This course is designed to provide experienced operators with relevant knowledge and understanding of practical use of the Industrial Counterbalance Forklift. In the Guru, when referring to overall width for class 2 & 3 trucks, overall width refers to the width of the power unit, not the outriggers. Specifically, adding such a large lift kit or monstrous wheels and tires can make daily driving around the city a real chore. No matter what size or capacity you need, you can find a rough terrain forklift for the job.</p>
