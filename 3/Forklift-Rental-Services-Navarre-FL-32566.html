Due to its smaller forklift dimensions, the pallet jack is not capable of lifting heavy weight. Two or three forklifts are usually shipped on the same load to minimize the freight charges. If you are driving aggressively in a lifted vehicle, it is a lot easier to spot the infraction and track your lifted truck down. Pallet jacks can cost less than $500 and powered hand trucks less than $3,000.</p>
<p>In digging around facts about a forklift rental company, some things you might consider are the company's service level agreements, the age and condition of their forklifts available for rent, as well as the questions they ask to rental enquiries.
