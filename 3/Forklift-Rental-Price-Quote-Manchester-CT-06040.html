Deduct this weight from your forklift's capacity and you know how much you can safely load on your pallet. First off, as you might expect, lifting a truck is a fairly complex procedure. On the other hand, there are order picker trucks that have forks that are fixed in front of the platform and thus cannot be moved.</p>
