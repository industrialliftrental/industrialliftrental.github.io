<p>While some may know forklifts primarily as a material handling appliance, there are in fact many different categories of forklifts. For starters, Crown's OnTrac Anti-Slip Traction Control on its narrow aisle reach trucks uses the forklift's on-board control system to determine whether the truck is losing traction.
