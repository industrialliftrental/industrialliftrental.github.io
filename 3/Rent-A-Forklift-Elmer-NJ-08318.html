But before getting into the technical components, we have to start with one of the most important considerations when comparing rough terrain forklifts: the dealer.</p>
<h2>Fork Truck Safety Elmer</h2>

<p>If you are a Private Individual looking to obtain a CPCS card for a Rough Terrain Forklift, the implications are very different from those of a CITB registered construction company. These lifts allow you to add beefier off-road tires and heavier suspension components but do come at a higher cost. Another place where pallet trucks are very useful and can often be found is in loading docks.</p>

<p>One of the main safety risks for order pickers is falling from height when exiting the cabin onto pallets, partially enclosed platforms or racking. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test OP1, or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. Knowing your specific needs and what forklift type best fits your application is very important when renting equipment for your job site.</p>
<p>From Truck Frame, power source to counterweight are essential for the forklift to function efficiently.

<p>Heavy duty design: 4mm steel plate fork frame and largerd lift piston ensure the truck to reach rated capacity. Four fixed-fork order pickers are ideally suited for picking bulky, oversized items or where extended platforms and industrial carts are used in place of pallets. If you need the forklift to operate under a fixed height structure, such as a container door then you should also consider the collapsed height of the mast.</p>
