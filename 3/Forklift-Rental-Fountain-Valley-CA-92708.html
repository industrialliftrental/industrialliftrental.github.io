Electric forklifts produce zero emissions. Better ground clearance than Pneumatic Tire forklift. Deduct this weight from your forklift's capacity and you know how much you can safely load on your pallet. First off, as you might expect, lifting a truck is a fairly complex procedure. On the other hand, there are order picker trucks that have forks that are fixed in front of the platform and thus cannot be moved.</p>

Predicting how many lift trucks you're going to need on any given day is difficult to do. To help you adapt to the ever-changing demands of your business, we have the largest fleet of short- or long-term rental trucks available, in-stock and ready for delivery.</p>

<p>Counterbalanced forklifts are weighted at the rear to prevent the vehicle from tipping forward when lifting a load. Moving mast reach forklifts have a higher ground clearance due to larger wheels, but are unable to handle double deep racking responsibilities without a fork extension attachment.
