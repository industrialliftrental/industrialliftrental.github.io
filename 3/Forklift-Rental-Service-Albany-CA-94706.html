However, just like a stock vehicle, some components in a lift kit can wear out over time, most notably the shock absorbers Some lift kits include shocks that are radically different from the stock units, meaning that replacing those shocks isn't always as simple as just looking your vehicle up. In this guide, we'll show you how to choose the correct shocks for a truck equipped with a lift kit.</p>
<p>The maximum weight, expressed in pounds, of a load with a stated horizontal and vertical distance to the center of gravity of the load that a given truck, based on the strength of the various components of the truck and, when applicable also on 406 of this Standard, can transport and stack to a height established by the manufacturer.

<p>Tilt Mast: Changing the angle of the mast and forks helps to load items and keep them balanced. Many of the most serious forklift accidents happen when a driver drops a payload.

<p>Forklifts have different shapes and sizes, also meet different and varied purposes. The hand pallet or lift truck has wheels located under the fork and uses a hydraulic jack for lifting and moving the pallets. These attachments, and the ability to extend the lifting capabilities with front outriggers, enable the tele-handler to complete work at heights that normal forklifts can't reach.</p>
<p>As forklift operators need to sit in their machine for hours together, a high-quality adjustable seat is essential. Front suspension drop-down brackets, or a crossmember cradle, allow the vehicle's suspension pickup points to be relocated at a lower position, which allows the vehicle to be lifted without changing the suspension's travel and steering geometry.</p>
<p>For trucks with tilting forks, the forks should be horizontal or at full upward tilt, whichever is less stable. While on the subject of suspension lifts, torsion bar twisting is an inexpensive method many people use to lift their truck, which may be OK for leveling, but it is not a true lift because it merely adjusts the level at which the truck sits in its suspension travel.</p>
