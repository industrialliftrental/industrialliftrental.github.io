<p>As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds. If other tests or tests for trucks over 10,000 pounds rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parties. Almost exclusively found on farms, tractor forklifts are simply a tractor with a forklift mast mounted on either the front or the back of the tractor.</p>
<p>Rough-terrain forklifts are ideal for construction sites because they can handle everything from loose dirt to finished flooring. The telescoping-boom rough terrain forklift is generally manufactured in separate, functional group sections: hydraulics, powertrain (engine, transmission, etc.), electrical, chassis, and boom. The answer is similar to electric forklifts above.</p>

<p>For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. Forklifts have a wide range in their lift capacity, ranging from as little as 3,000 pounds to as much as 35,000 pounds or more. Fortunately, for those of us who love big trucks, there are many companies out there offering big-brake upgrade kits.</p>
<p>In order to counterbalance” a heavy front load, this type of lift has significant weight toward the rear of the vehicle; this promotes overall stability, even during transport. Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation avoid tipovers and accidents. Suitable for heavy-duty applications, our multidirectional reach truck is capable of handling both conventional pallets and long loads, such as steel beams and plastic pipes.</p>

Another place where pallet trucks are very useful and can often be found is in loading docks.</p>
