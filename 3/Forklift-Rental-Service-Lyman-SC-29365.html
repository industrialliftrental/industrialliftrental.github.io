A warning light must automatically activate when an order picker's platform is six feet or higher and the forklift is in motion. Like the pallets themselves, pallet jacks have become a lot more standardized in North America as of late. Also, note that loads longer than 48” will extend your load center beyond the standard rating of a 24” load center.</p>
