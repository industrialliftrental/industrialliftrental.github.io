<p>Toyota's Double Reach Truck can help take you operations to new heights. There are few vehicles that turn heads around Dayton and Troy as well as a new lifted truck Southern Comfort Automotive Performance is a manufacturer recognized upfitter, meaning they design upgrades for trucks which are then installed and sold at the dealership, giving you a custom look and feel without the headaches of taking it to an upfitter after buying it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Crown introduced a new 2-stage TL mast , commonly referred to as a Truckers Mast,” for its Crown FC 5200 Series counterbalance forklifts and the pneumatic and cushion tire models of the Crown C-5 Series industrial forklifts. Some small work zones and warehouses require a compact-sized forklift for safe maneuvering and material handling, while more demanding loads require a heavy-duty model designed for maximum lifting power or extra height.</p>

The Teletruk offers typical savings of up to 30% on operating costs compared to a masted forklift truck. Yet large trucks can't be raised and driven safely until their brakes are modified. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity.</p>

<p>The four models in Xtreme Manufacturing's XT-B Series of straight-mast forklifts range in lifting capacity from 6,000 to 12,000 pounds at increments of 2,000 pounds.

Forklift capacities often range from 3,000 - 7,000 lbs, meaning you can load at least 1,600 lbs on your pallet with the order picker. However, for a warehouse with narrow aisles, having a maneuverable forklift capable of reaching in excess of ten meters makes the reach truck a considerable adversary in the right conditions.</p>
<p>Due to their variety in fueling, size and either a four or three wheel design, counterbalance forklifts are arguably the more versatile of the two trucks. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads. 2It will probably be necessary to cover the surface of the tilting platform with a friction-increasing material such as liquid paint, adhesive applied tape containing friction material, or safety tread with perforated buttons.</p>
