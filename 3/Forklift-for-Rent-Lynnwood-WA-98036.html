<p>These forklifts are known for what their name indicates, their ability to lift loads at a high altitude. Because of these possibilities, operators should be careful to keep the center of gravity firmly within the stability triangle. Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.</p>
<p>Their high capacity of up to three tons and easy manoeuvrability in tight spaces make hand pallet trucks the perfect warehouse aid. Although forklifts are fairly easy machines to operate, it is recommended that all drivers receive proper forklift training and certification. Whether you need an electric lift rental, internal combustion machine, multi-direction side loader, narrow aisle and high-density lift, rough terrain or truck and trailer mounted forklift, you can find it at our convenient Sacramento store.</p>

<p>Counterbalanced forklifts are weighted at the rear to prevent the vehicle from tipping forward when lifting a load.

<p>216.1 (1) No person shall alter an industrial lift truck in such a way as to render ineffective a safety device installed on the truck, except where the alteration has been certified in writing by the manufacturer of the device or an engineer as affording protection equal to or greater than the protection afforded by the original device.

<p>There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front. Turret Trucks are battery operated machines that use both the electric engine, battery and operator compartment to counterweigh heavy loads. Safety on and off the road is the foremost issue concerning all lifted vehicles.</p>
<p>Renting your forklift can also mean significantly lower up-front costs and the ability to plan on consistent monthly expenditures. Failure to secure truck or trailer with blocks can cause the trailer to move resulting in the forklift falling between the trailer and the dock.

<p>Reality: the higher a heavy load is lifted, the less safe a forklift becomes. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury.
