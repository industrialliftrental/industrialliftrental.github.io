<p>They provide a reliable, economical material handling solution. This reflects an order intake of 109,200 forklifts (+12.5%) and 106,300 units produced (+16.6%). Electric forklifts run on a battery and or more expensive than their IC counterparts upfront, but are much less expensive long-term (no fuel costs). Owing to the increase in the size of the wheels, you also need sizeable brakes to bring the lifted truck to a stop safely.</p>
<p>This internal transport equipment makes loading and unloading more efficiently, which results in a more productive working day. The 3,500 lb. forklift uses the same body style as the 3,000 lb. The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight, which gives the extra 500 lb. capacity.

<p>Even with standard forklift certification, it is very important to have Rough Terrain Forklift certification training as well. These machines are designed to work where the going gets rough, as their name implies. Different types of tyres are available for forklifts. Before settling on what forklift to purchase or rent, be certain you've got a good idea of the weights and dimensions of the loads you intend to lift.</p>
<p>Weight capacity is an important detail when planning your forklift rental because you do not want to pay for a rental only to find that it cannot safely lift the loads you need to handle. This hybrid design gives operators the flexibility to program the truck to run on its own or operate manually as a traditional lift truck.

<p>It may be necessary to travel long distances with the load to the rear in reverse for most forklifts. There are two main types of side loader forklifts, the enclosed cab that is most commonly used outdoors, and a stand up version that is more suited to indoor tasks. Remember that the price of the equipment isn't the only cost you'll incur if you purchase a forklift.</p>
