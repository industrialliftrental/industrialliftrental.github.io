The Linde forklifts are distinguished by their innovative industrial technology, ensuring customer confidence in the brand. Pallet jack - A forked vehicle for manual movement of a single pallet, similar to Class III trucks above, but with no power source for lifting or travel.

All-round ergonomic working conditions are a fundamental part of the truck designs, including vibration-cushioned platforms, intuitively laid out control panels, low entry height and sufficient space for terminals and mounting brackets.
