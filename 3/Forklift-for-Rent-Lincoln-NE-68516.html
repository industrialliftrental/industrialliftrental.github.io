<p>We are offering Premium quality Heavy & Medium Load capacity hydraulic Hand Pallet truck. Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>
<p>These forklifts are known for what their name indicates, their ability to lift loads at a high altitude. Because of these possibilities, operators should be careful to keep the center of gravity firmly within the stability triangle. Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.</p>

I appreciate the informative post and pictures you have shared of different types of forklifts.

<p>Forklifts generally fall into two categories: industrial and rough terrain. The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load-center dimension and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck. When the lift truck's center of gravity falls within the perimeter of this triangle, a load is safe to carry.</p>
