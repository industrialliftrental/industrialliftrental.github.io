Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that a line connecting the center of either load-wheel tire (or outermost tire where multiple tires are used) and the projection perpendicular to the platform of the point of intersection of the longitudinal centerline of the truck and the centerline of the steering wheels is parallel to the axis of the tilting of the platform, and with the steering wheel nearest the tilting axis parallel to the axis.</p>
<p>Look out for any uneven surfaces that could result in technical difficulties for the stability and longevity of your reach forklift. Lifted cars have the potential to run right over smaller vehicles in the event of a high-speed accident. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident, because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.</p>
<p>It is good practice to keep the load back against the truck mast as much as possible. If you're looking specifically for Toyota forklifts, this is where you need to look. Ensure loads are stacked evenly on the forks before moving the pallet jack. ICE forklifts can handle loads of up to 15,500 pounds and are ideal for indoor operation on smooth floors.
