Rent diesel or LP-gas forklift or rent a specialized material handling forklift, such as a truck-mounted forklift or piggyback truck. At Cat® Lift Trucks we design and build counterbalance forklift trucks for every application. It is rumored that electric forklifts are maintenance free due to less moving parts and their cleaner environments. Additionally Pengate rentals offer the following advantages: low rates (which include batteries and chargers); rental rates may be expensible for tax purposes; maintenance service by our Raymond Certified Technicians at no added charge; the ability to opt into a rent-to-own program.</p>

<p>These forklifts are best when you use the vehicle for a set time each day. The Class I, Class II, and Class IV have a moderated growth rate over the forecast period as end-users are largely adopting Class III and Class V Forklift Trucks for the various applications. The reason that these trucks are ideally suited for off road driving is that the body of the truck is protected by the fact that it's several feet away from the ground, meaning that it's less likely to come into collision with the ground or other objects on the ground.</p>
<p>The hydraulic pallet truck is very rigid, rugged and can take continuous heavy punishment in abusive Indian conditions. Browse our selection of lifted Ford, Chevy, and Dodge lifted trucks. If you already have one of our electric forklift trucks, it can be easily retrofitted with lithium-ion power.
