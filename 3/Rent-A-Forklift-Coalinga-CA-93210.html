<p>Equally important is the amount of usage you will require of your forklift. Order picker forklifts can handle loads of 3,000 pounds or more. Whether you need a compact electric lift truck for your narrow aisles, a big boy 110,000 lb. lift for your quarry operation or anything in between, you can count on Altorfer Cat.

If the bottom of this line goes outside of the stability triangle - because a load is too heavy or too high, or because the forklift is not on a level surface - it will tip over.</p>
