<p>Industrial counterbalance forklifts are the most common trucks used in indoor warehouses and stores. JJ Training (UK) offers two services: Trainees can attend our training facility Our fully qualified assessors and trainers can visit the trainee's place of work for site specific training JJ Training(UK) Limited provides fully accredited operator training for novices and experienced operators on all makes and models of fork lift trucks as well as providing conversion (from other truck type) and refresher training.</p>
<p>Gradability = The maximum percent of a slope a lift truck can negotiate with a capacity load. The United Academy provides a broad range of training and certification across all equipment use and handling skills. For example, a hydraulic skate is not the same as a counterbalanced tricycle, although both are classified as forklifts. In industry sectors where robust and versatile equipment is required, two materials handling options - telehandlers and rough-terrain forklifts - stand out.</p>
<p>Service intervals of 1,000 operating hours mean that trucks operate reliably. Whether you're using the truck to commute to work every day or planning to carve your own path offroad, choosing the right lift kit is a crucial decision. Not all kits are created equal, and a rough-riding rig can add to fatigue on long trips, make controlling the vehicle exhausting, and put wear on the truck itself.</p>

The following tests are designed to verify rated capacities of counterbalanced trucks having rated capacities up to and including 20,000 lb at 24 inches load center and to determine capacity or alternate rated capacity.</p>
