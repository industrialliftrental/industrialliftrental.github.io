Mainly for external use, the Toyota range of diesel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and gasoline (petrol) engine powered forklifts offers load capacities ranging from 1.0 to 16.0 tons. Forklift operators can lift up and lower the forks, use side shifters to move loads and tilt the mast so the load doesn't slide off the forks.</p>
<p>At Westminster Lift Truck Services, we always recommend that with the money needed for buying a new forklift, you can buy more used forklifts to improve your workforce productivity and have the budget for minor maintenance. The load of the forks must be balanced by the weight of the lift truck in order for this principle to work. With their stronger frames, they can lift heavier loads higher than forklifts that operate in warehouses, for example.</p>

Additionally, the adoption of technologically advanced lift trucks will enable an increase in the lift trucks market size in the coming years.

The mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets.</p>
