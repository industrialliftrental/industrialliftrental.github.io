The lift truck industry experienced a host of new equipment innovations over the past year. Before choosing a standup forklift, it's important to determine the size of the typical load that you will be lifting.</p>
<p>You can rely on Westminster Lift Truck Services. On an F-150, one needs about a 4" lift to put on 35" diameter tires which is really the minimum for off road use here.

H Series forklifts use a Diesel Oxidation Catalyst to meet Tier 4 Final emissions standards. Powered pallet jacks: These jacks contain an electric motor which assists the user in lifting and moving heavier and even stacked pallets. These calculations take into account variations in design including tire, mast, and other deflections, and provide a means for predicting with reasonable accuracy the stability of fork trucks.</p>
<p>Although trucks are rated at 24 inches load center, the load center for Test #N3 should be either 24 or 16 inches - whichever would produce the less stable condition. Handling material can be a very tedious and tiring process. The pump ''top-of-stroke'' hydraulic fluid bypass minimizes stress on the system when the load is raised to maximum lift height. Industrial Forklifts serve as very useful equipment at the construction sites, as it can be used to carry hefty building materials over long distances, across the rough terrain.</p>

Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
