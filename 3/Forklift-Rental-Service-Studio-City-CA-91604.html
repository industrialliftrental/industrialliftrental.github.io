The traditional model of the forklift stability triangle is useful, but it leaves out one important thing: three-dimensional space. Stand-Up Rider = A lift truck designed to be controlled by an operator standing. But if the forklift is put in motion, or sits on a sloping surface, its center of gravity shifts.</p>
<p>Place empty truck on an initially level test platform in a position that the centerline of a truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the test platform and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position. These Lifts are designed to be able to lock on to the back of large over the road delivery trucks so they may be transported to work sites and then be able to off load product being delivered utilizing side offloading of the delivery truck.</p>
