Raymond counterbalanced lift trucks offer efficiency, productivity, and versatility. High load capacity and small exterior dimensions; this combination leads to increased handling capacity because compact pallet trucks are easier to maneuver in narrow aisles.</p>
<p>Double-deep trucks are similar, but with longer forks, making them perfect for areas where multiple pallet loads are stored in each bay as they will reach right to the back of the bay. When you rent a rough terrain forklift, you want to make sure it has enough power to do the job. We have uniquely positioned ourselves as a topmost enterprise, engaged in offering a precision-engineered range of Hydraulic Pallet Hand Trucks.</p>
<h2>Pallet Jack Balch Springs</h2>
<p>An electrically powered walkie stacker, for loads 2,000 - 4,000lbs, in which the electrical fittings and equipment are designed to be used in atmospheres containing specifically named flammable vapors, dusts, and under certain conditions, fibers. Single-double forks - forks that in the closed position allow movement of a single pallet or platform but when separated, turn into a set of double forks that allow carrying two pallets side by side.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that forklift rentals aren't the only warehouse equipment leases we'll do - floor cleaning equipment, personnel carriers, burden carriers and more are all available to rent out. The following tests are designed to verify rated capacities of counterbalanced trucks having rated capacities up to and including 20,000 lb at 24 inches load center and to determine capacity or alternate rated capacity.</p>

<p>Apart from this, a feedback of the spec sheet for Jungheinrich's 5000 lb. Electric counterbalanced truck shows that it has actually eclipsed the performance specifications of most internal combustion trucks. The test load should be equivalent to an unrestrained, homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension, and should equal in weight the rated capacity of the truck.</p>
