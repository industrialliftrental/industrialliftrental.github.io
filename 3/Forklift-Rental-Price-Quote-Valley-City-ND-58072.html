This is an example of a ruggedly constructed forklift and is designed to be used primarily outdoors. With FLC's training, they'll learn how to properly and safely drive both regular and three-wheel counterbalance lifts, maneuver their way through tight spaces, properly handle and travel with heavy loads and avoid collisions, falling objects and other types of accidents.</p>

Whether you are looking for a manual, semi-electric or fully electric pallet truck, you can find them all at TVH. The answers are also important for you to choose the correct forklift attachments to do the job at hand. Choose the correct shock absorbers based on which end or ends of the vehicle you're working on. Keep in mind that some trucks use struts on the front and shock absorbers on the rear.</p>

In England a 40-cell unit has been used to drive a forklift truck and to do electric welding. When most people think of forklifts, they think of an operator sitting behind the wheel.
