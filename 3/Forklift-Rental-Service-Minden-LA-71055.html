<p>Stand-up trucks are the most common and are often used where there's only one load per bay. Cargo type - You need to consider factors like the packaging of your cargo, the type of pallets used, and whether or not the load has a unique shape. The machine also provides a maximum load capacity of 5,000 pounds. Some of our forklift dealers carry rough terrain forklifts, telehandlers and scissor lifts.</p>

The Toyota Forklifts website is owned by the Toyota company, and is the definitive resource for renting quality approved equipment.

<p>Telescopic forks - hydraulic attachments that allow the operator to operate in warehouse design for "double-deep stacking", which means that two pallet shelves are placed behind each other without any aisle between them. Attachments can be used with forklifts to make the work easier and add additional functions. SFS's Hand Pallet truck can also be used for carrying small non palletised loads with suitable improvisation to hold the load on the forks.</p>
<p>There are two different ways that lift kits are designed, which dictates how they are installed and each one lifts the truck in a different way. Whether you're considering a lifted truck for work, pleasure, or both, there are some important benefits to think about as you get ready to decide what your next vehicle purchase should be. When your application requires the power of an internal combustion forklift, count on Crown to provide the right combination of strength, durability, operator comfort and application flexibility to meet your needs.</p>
