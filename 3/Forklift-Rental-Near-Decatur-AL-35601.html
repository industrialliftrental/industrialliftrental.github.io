It offers quick acceleration and fast lift speeds to keep your operators moving. Warehouses and shop storerooms can operate with more complexity than ever before, and with our collection of fine order pickers for sale, the sky is quite literally the limit. This is highlighted by the impressive load capacity: Our low-level order pickers, for instance, can lift up to three pallets weighing up to 2.5 tons with their 2.4 metre long forks.</p>
<p>They provide a reliable, economical material handling solution. This reflects an order intake of 109,200 forklifts (+12.5%) and 106,300 units produced (+16.6%). Electric forklifts run on a battery and or more expensive than their IC counterparts upfront, but are much less expensive long-term (no fuel costs).
