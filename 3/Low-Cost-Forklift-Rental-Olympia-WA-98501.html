<p>Many lifted truck stores put lifts on high mile trucks, and this can lead to a poor ride and other issues that are associated with lifted vehicles. As a result of the flip-up driver platform and Click-2-Creep, these powered pallet trucks are ideal for working in confined areas and for loading and unloading lorries. The heavy-duty models that can lift big loads have an even larger fork shaft and double wheels at the front.</p>

<p>While some may know forklifts primarily as a material handling appliance, there are in fact many different categories of forklifts. For starters, Crown's OnTrac Anti-Slip Traction Control on its narrow aisle reach trucks uses the forklift's on-board control system to determine whether the truck is losing traction.

One of the key features of this type of forklift is that they are counterbalanced — meaning that the battery also functions as a counterweight for stability.
