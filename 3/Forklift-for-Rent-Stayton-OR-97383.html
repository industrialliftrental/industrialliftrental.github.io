<p>Ground clearance same as cushion tire forklift. Yes, it's going to be harder to get in and out of your truck, but a twisted ankle or scraped knee is a small price to pay compared to a truck body rocketing off of its suspension due to some shoddy craftsmanship.

One of the most popular adjustments to trucks is the lift kit - moving the entire truck higher in the air by changing out suspension parts. Pole attachments - in some locations, such as carpet warehouses, a long metal pole is used instead of forks to lift carpet rolls.</p>
<p>All depends on the make, model, type of forklift, and lifting capacity - in general, most standard 2-ton counterbalance forklifts cost a few hundred dollars per day to rent, and larger forklifts with bigger lifting capacities cost significantly more.
