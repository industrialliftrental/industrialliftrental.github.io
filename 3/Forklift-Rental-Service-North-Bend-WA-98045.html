A lifted truck is any truck that has a high suspension system that can accommodate larger tires.</p>
<p>Well, one of the simplest ways to make a truck stand out is integrating a body lift kit or suspension lift kit.

For example a pallet jack is not the same as a three-wheel counterbalance lift truck yet they are both classed as a forklift. This means that Linde reach trucks can maneuver safely and quickly, even in confined spaces and handling conditions in warehouses.</p>
<p>Most custom lifted trucks are purely aesthetic, even the height of the lift. Most standard forklifts can reach heights between 10 and 15 ft, but special forklifts like the telehandler can lift as high as 55 ft depending on the telehandler size you select. The huge demand for lift trucks for material handling equipment across several industries such as construction, mining, and food & beverage will favor the growth of the lift trucks market in the Asia Pacific.</p>
