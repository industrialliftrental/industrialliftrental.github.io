<h2>Forklift Safety Guide In Galt </h2>
<p>The four models in Xtreme Manufacturing's XT-B Series of straight-mast forklifts range in lifting capacity from 6,000 to 12,000 pounds at increments of 2,000 pounds.

<p>I notice two things right off the bat; one, the truck looks just about at home up there on that lift kit as it does on its stock ride height; and two, it hasn't seemed to have aged. Suspension lifts, particularly longarm kits, can require extensive modification to the vehicle and should only be installed by a skilled professional. Common uses for these types of forklifts run the gamut, including agriculture, oil refineries, construction, manufacturing, paper mills, and pipe yards.</p>
