<p>Manual pallet jacks have existed since at least 1918. Commonly known as forklifts, pallet trucks, rider trucks, forktrucks, or lifttrucks. We supply electric and propane forklifts with the option of a narrow aisle style. The Mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets. It is not uncommon for the lift axle to operate with a much smaller tire, however, the tire is often of a greater ply rating and able to support more weight than the larger truck tires.</p>
<p>By raising the truck's chassis, more room is provided for large size tires and wheels. Every forklift has an identification plate that lists important information about the truck. Compact and high powered reach trucks of 1.3ton up to 2.5ton capacity offer fast response, easy operation and smooth load handling for high-density warehouse handling efficiency.

<p>Depends on the pallet jack type and capacity. The reach truck typically works as part of a material-handling system where two requirements are equally important: cube utilization (ratio of occupied space to total cubic space available, usually expressed as a percentage) and selectivity (amount or percentage of product in a warehouse which is accessible to the aisle for picking).</p>
