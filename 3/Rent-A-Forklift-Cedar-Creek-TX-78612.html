Hand Pallet Trucks are equipped with quality materials, offering its high strength and durability. Gas powered forklifts are more popular than their electric counterparts.

Our company, over the years, with its vast experience in this domain offers wide range of Heavy Duty Pallet Truck for various industrial uses.
