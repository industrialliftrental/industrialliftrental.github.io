Hand Pallet Trucks are equipped with quality materials, offering its high strength and durability. Gas powered forklifts are more popular than their electric counterparts.

<p>Our rental fleet has over 900 rentals ready for use at short notice. Lifted trucks have a negative reputation for being unsafe, but that's simply untrue. Any time the forklift's center of gravity moves outside the stability triangle, the lift will tip over.

There are numerous types of fork lifts produced to service a variety of industries, and they fluctuate greatly in terms of size and operation. Cost Effectiveness: Unless you need a forklift for 52 weeks a year indefinitely, spending $30,000 or so for a new machine just doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>However, class 4s specifically are commonly used indoors for short bursts to transport loads to and from the loading docks. Our company, over the years, with its vast experience in this domain offers wide range of Heavy Duty Pallet Truck for various industrial uses.
