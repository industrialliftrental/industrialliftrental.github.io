<p>PA Industrial Equipment, Inc. HIGH-LIFT PLATFORM TRUCK: A self-loading truck equipped with a load platform, intended primarily for transporting and tiering loaded skid platforms (Fig. OSHA General Industry Standard 1910.178()(1) Only stable or safely arranged loads shall be handled. Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation to avoid tipovers and accidents.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Crown introduced a new 2-stage TL mast , commonly referred to as a Truckers Mast,‚Äù for its Crown FC 5200 Series counterbalance forklifts and the pneumatic and cushion tire models of the Crown C-5 Series industrial forklifts. Some small work zones and warehouses require a compact-sized forklift for safe maneuvering and material handling, while more demanding loads require a heavy-duty model designed for maximum lifting power or extra height.</p>
<p>This internal transport equipment makes loading and unloading more efficiently, which results in a more productive working day. The 3,500 lb. forklift uses the same body style as the 3,000 lb. The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight, which gives the extra 500 lb. capacity. We offer lifted trucks across a variety of models and trim levels, so no matter if you're shopping for a baseline full-size pickup or an upgraded heavy duty model, you can secure whichever you need with a lifted upgrade.</p>

<p>Ground clearance same as cushion tire forklift. Yes, it's going to be harder to get in and out of your truck, but a twisted ankle or scraped knee is a small price to pay compared to a truck body rocketing off of its suspension due to some shoddy craftsmanship. When you are finished with the rental it is a good idea to properly clean the forklift. The most obvious benefit is the increased ground clearance when driving over rugged terrain, which reduces the risk of damage to your undercarriage.</p>
