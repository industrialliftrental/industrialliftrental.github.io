<p>Here we are talking about ways to improve your business with the help of a hand pallet truck. Safety for order-pickers who work around high-lift trucks is as important as safety for the drivers. We manufacturer heavy duty and extra heavy duty pallets for 3.5 ton and 5 ton load handling. Gregory Poole is proud to offer the best forklift rentals selection in Virginia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.</p>

<p>Raymond orderpickers feature variable lift and lower, simultaneous function control handles and power steering with auto-steer centering to improve load handling to increase productivity. The forks, supported by the two front wheels, are raised hydraulically to lift the pallet. Now, a lot of later model 4WD's do need a "mild" lift-usually less than 4"-to improve their ground clearance for serious backcountry trail work, but-again-most 4WD's never see anything rougher than a gravel road.</p>
<p>Forklifts also come in standup models. With lift heights of up to 8.5 meters and load capacities from 1.2 to 3 tons, the Toyota 7FBRE series, 8FBRE series and BT Reflex series offers truck models suitable for block stacking, drive-in racking, and long load handling. Rear steering makes it difficult to stop a forklift quickly or swerve and still maintain control.</p>
