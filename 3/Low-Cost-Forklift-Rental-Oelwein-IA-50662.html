Keep all parts of your body inside the industrial lift truck when travelling; travel with the forks as low to the floor as possible; decrease speed around corners and sound the horn; and, travel in reverse when a load obstructs your vision. You shouldn't ever buy forklifts that haven't had a Thorough Examinations test done, and you shouldn't purchase from a forklift sales dealer who doesn't know the ins and outs of lifting equipment.</p>
