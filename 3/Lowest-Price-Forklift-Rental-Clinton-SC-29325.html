<p>Order picking trucks have a working platform that helps the operator to control the lift. With lift capacities of 5,000, 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, respectively, the three established G Series rough-terrain forklift models offered by Case can be equipped with two mast heights — 15 and 22 feet — to cover most applications.

<p>Note: In order to receive your C4 Forklift Operation Certification, you must take and pass a performance evaluation given by your employer at your job site. It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable.</p>
<p>Northwest Forklift is a locally owned and operated material handling dealer in business since 1976, with experience in small to large material handling equipment. Just knowing the challenges associated with a lifted vehicle can help you increase safety in and around your truck.

Most rented forklifts include a full maintenance package that covers all consumables, repairs, etc. A used stand-up narrow aisle forklift with a 300 lb. capacity and 212 inch lift height might cost around $7,000 to $9,000.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load at maximum elevation shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a slope of 4 percent about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang. Contact used forklift dealers and other possible sellers.</p>

<p>For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.

Fortunately, for those of us who love big trucks, there are many companies out there offering big-brake upgrade kits.</p>
