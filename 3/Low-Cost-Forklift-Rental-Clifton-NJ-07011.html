<p>Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels. Almost identical to the 6,000 lb. 4-wheel, the 6,500 lb. truck has a slightly heavier counterweight. The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it.
