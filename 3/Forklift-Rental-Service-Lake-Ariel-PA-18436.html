Renting offers you more financial flexibility, allowing you to keep capital free for other business opportunities. The JCB Teletruk 30 Logistics offers typical savings of up to 30% on operating costs compared to a masted forklift truck.

<p>As forklift operators need to sit in their machine for hours together, a high-quality adjustable seat is essential. Front suspension drop-down brackets, or a crossmember cradle, allow the vehicle's suspension pickup points to be relocated at a lower position, which allows the vehicle to be lifted without changing the suspension's travel and steering geometry.</p>
