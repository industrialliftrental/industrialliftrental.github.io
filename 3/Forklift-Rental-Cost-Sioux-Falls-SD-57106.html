<p>Toyota Forklift is proud to have the biggest range of forklifts and battery-electric warehouse equipment available in South-Africa, ensuring that whatever your requirements we have a suitable material handling solution. Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load at maximum elevation and at maximum rearward tilt permitted by the truck mechanism, at that elevation, shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope about an axis parallel to a line connecting the center or either load wheel tire (or outermost tire where multiple tires are used) and the projection perpendicular to the platform of the point of intersection of the longitudinal centerline of the truck and centerline of the steering wheels.</p>
<p>Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines.

They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs.

The jack is steered by a ' tiller ' like lever that also acts as the pump handle for raising the jack.</p>

It will mean you can drive 99% of all forklift trucks in the UK. As you already have experience, and the training is shorter, the cost for this is less than the beginner training.</p>
