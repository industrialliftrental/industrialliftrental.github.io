Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads. 2It will probably be necessary to cover the surface of the tilting platform with a friction-increasing material such as liquid paint, adhesive applied tape containing friction material, or safety tread with perforated buttons.</p>
