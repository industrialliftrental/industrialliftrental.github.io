<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. Due to its smaller forklift dimensions, the pallet jack is not capable of lifting heavy weight. Two or three forklifts are usually shipped on the same load to minimize the freight charges. If you are driving aggressively in a lifted vehicle, it is a lot easier to spot the infraction and track your lifted truck down. Pallet jacks can cost less than $500 and powered hand trucks less than $3,000.</p>
<p>It will allow you to efficiently pick goods on a pallet and quickly move from rack to rack as well as give you the ability to drive the lifter into a container in order to unload goods. Each type of powered industrial truck presents different operating hazards. Pallet jacks are manufactured in a range of sizes, power options and lift capacity. We offer forklift sales and rentals that include everything from pallet stackers to reach trucks.</p>
<p>When lifting a load, a reach truck moves the load back within the wheelbase, meaning less of the load is protruding from the reach truck. In the event of a crash with a lifted truck, the injuries can be extensive. We only sell forklifts that we are confident to be a great value for the condition it is in. Through our connections and many resources, we are always adding units to our inventory, giving you a wide selection of makes and models to suit the needs of your operation.</p>
