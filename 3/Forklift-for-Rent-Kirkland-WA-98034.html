<p>Rough terrain forklifts are reliable, versatile and easy-to-use. While size plays an important role, forklifts carry an impressive amount of weight due to their special design. In 2019, counterbalance forklift trucks accounted for more than 60% industry share. If you drive a forklift on an incline, you must keep the load on the uphill side.

These types of kits suspend the frame, body, engine, and the powertrain all above the wheels. The aim of training candidates on N001 - Industrial Counterbalance Forklift is to provide them with basic knowledge and practical skills to NPORS high standard.</p>

<p>Although trucks are rated at 24 inches load center, the load center for Test #N3 should be either 24 or 16 inches - whichever would produce the less stable condition. Handling material can be a very tedious and tiring process. The pump ''top-of-stroke'' hydraulic fluid bypass minimizes stress on the system when the load is raised to maximum lift height.
