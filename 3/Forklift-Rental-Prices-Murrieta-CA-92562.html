<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. Due to its smaller forklift dimensions, the pallet jack is not capable of lifting heavy weight. Two or three forklifts are usually shipped on the same load to minimize the freight charges. If you are driving aggressively in a lifted vehicle, it is a lot easier to spot the infraction and track your lifted truck down. Pallet jacks can cost less than $500 and powered hand trucks less than $3,000.</p>
<p>Stay up to date by perusing manuals, guides, and literature put out by the manufacturers of the forklifts as well as the industry leaders.

Forklifts come with safety equipment such as an overhead guard over the operator area in front of the mast and another protecting the driver's seat.</p>
<p>Expect only the best when you choose Industrial Lift Truck as your forklift dealer. The easiest way to stop a potential runaway is to quickly squeeze the handle and drop the pallet to the floor.
