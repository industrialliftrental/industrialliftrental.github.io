<h2>The History Of The Hand Pallet Truck Tooele </h2>
<p>When not used for picking, these trucks can also be used for the transport or stacking of pallets. The SP Series order picker forklift provides the most unobstructed view and eliminates tunnel vision,” increasing operator confidence - especially at height. Renowned for their sturdiness and performance even in very extreme conditions, the all-terrain Manitou Forklift trucks go where others do not.</p>
<p>Counterbalanced forklifts are weighted at the rear to prevent the vehicle from tipping forward when lifting a load. Moving mast reach forklifts have a higher ground clearance due to larger wheels, but are unable to handle double deep racking responsibilities without a fork extension attachment. If these tests are used to determine capacity or alternate rated capacities, use appropriate loads and load centers instead of those herein specified.</p>
