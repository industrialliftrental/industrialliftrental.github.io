<p>Order picking trucks have a working platform that helps the operator to control the lift. Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

<p>Masts are built based on the lifting height provided and can be: double, with two telescopic bodies that extend when lifting begins; double with full free lifting, in which, unlike for the previous type, the telescopic mast does not extend until the fork has been completely raised; and triple, with three telescopic bodies.
