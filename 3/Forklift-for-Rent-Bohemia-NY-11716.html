<p>Gas forklifts constantly need to be refilled, so the recurring need to purchase fuel makes the long-term costs hefty. Forklifts vary in size, ranging from one ton capacity for general warehouse related work to 50 ton capacity for shipping container work. Whereas the standard order pickers have fixed forks that can only be driven in or out of the pallet, the swing-reach's forks can approach pallets from a variety of positions.</p>
<p>Buy used forklifts from the top manufacturers including Toyota, Cat, Komatsu, and more. Jacks feature 4mm-thick steel construction, with reinforced fork bracing and sealed ball bearings on wheels. The forks on a reach truck are attached to a pantograph mechanism that extends them forward to place in or retrieve pallets from warehouse racking.

A common complaint amongst drivers of taller vehicles (particularly those driving trucks lifted by more than 6-inches) is the difficulty of finding an insurance provider willing to work with them.</p>
