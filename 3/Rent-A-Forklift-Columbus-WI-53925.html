Renting offers you more financial flexibility, allowing you to keep capital free for other business opportunities. The JCB Teletruk 30 Logistics offers typical savings of up to 30% on operating costs compared to a masted forklift truck. If forklift-operating companies deployed more stringent training policies, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) says that about approximatetly 70% of forklift accidents in the US could be prevented.</p>
<p>Renting your forklift can also mean significantly lower up-front costs and the ability to plan on consistent monthly expenditures. Failure to secure truck or trailer with blocks can cause the trailer to move resulting in the forklift falling between the trailer and the dock.

Keep in mind that body lifting can only raise vehicles from 1 to 3 inches total, which means you cannot get a huge lift from these kits. Always start the engine while seated in the operator's position—never while standing alongside the forklift.</p>
