<p>JCB rough terrain forklifts are a reliable, comfortable, versatile and easy-to-use solution for any challenging rehandling environment. In a stand-up forklift, most often they require the use of a joystick which can present a learning curve to some operators. Our rental lift trucks are maintained to the industry's highest standards and undergo comprehensive pre-rental inspections to ensure consistent performance and reliable operations. Also for rent, sit-down, stand-on or walk-behind forklifts.</p>
<p>Toyota's industrial vehicle and equipment business started in March 1956 with lift truck production and sales in Japan. However, the deaths of nearly 100 workers and 20,000 serious injuries that occur each year show that a forklift can be dangerous. Whether you're looking for lifted truck shocks or, specifically, shocks for a 6-inch lift, you can rest assured we'll have what you need.</p>
<p>The truck should be equipped with the attachment and the test load (when required) should be representative of the capacity of the truck and attachment combination. So if you need additional materials handling equipment to keep your business up and running, we can help. If you find anything wrong with the forklift during the walk-around or seated inspection, do not operate it until it has been repaired.</p>
