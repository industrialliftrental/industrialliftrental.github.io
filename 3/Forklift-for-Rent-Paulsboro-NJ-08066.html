<p>Our company has a variety of finance options available on our forklifts for sale to simplify the process for you and get you back to work quickly. The rough-terrain or straight-mast forklift has become more of a niche machine, rather than an ‘everybody-needs-one' machine,” says Charlie Detrich, U.S. sales & dealer development manager for Liftking. Heubel Shaw's large rental fleet includes Reach trucks, Stand up forklifts, sitdown 4-wheel and 3-wheel forklifts, order pickers and pallet jacks.</p>

These forklifts can reach heights of 20 feet or more and can be found in warehousing operations.</p>
