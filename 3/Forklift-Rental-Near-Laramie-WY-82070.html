There's a wide variety of styles and designs available, some capable of moving loads of 5000lbs, but the main difference is between the lift and pallet trucks.</p>

<p>With our electric reach trucks, you will enjoy a number of technical and ergonomic benefits. The operator essentially is lifted or lowered to the stock position with the load in order to get access to the product. This means there is approximately a 35% reduction in the turning circle of the forklift, making the reach forklift far more maneuverable than the standard counterbalance forklift.</p>
<p>Its stabilized legs and forward extending forks enables this warehouse truck to extend upwards to reach racks that are usually too high for a standard forklift.
