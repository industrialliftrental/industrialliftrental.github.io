<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height for the limit of travel speed, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified by Graph C about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
<p>To replace hydraulic pallet truck when under 300kg load.Pallet are simply lifted by pulling the handle backward, more efficient. Using the add-a-leaf will increase the height, but sometimes makes the suspension ride rough because of the added spring rate.

<p>With most models, you'll get two forks that allow your crew to pick up and lift all kinds of pallets.

<p>There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front. Turret Trucks are battery operated machines that use both the electric engine, battery and operator compartment to counterweigh heavy loads. Safety on and off the road is the foremost issue concerning all lifted vehicles.</p>
<p>Telescopic forks - hydraulic attachments that allow the operator to operate in warehouse design for "double-deep stacking", which means that two pallet shelves are placed behind each other without any aisle between them. Attachments can be used with forklifts to make the work easier and add additional functions. SFS's Hand Pallet truck can also be used for carrying small non palletised loads with suitable improvisation to hold the load on the forks.</p>
<p>Configurations include Sit Down Forklifts, Stand Up Reach, Pallet Jacks, Scissor Lifts and many others. This is the total amount of weight the forklift can move off the ground. Common industries where electric pallet jacks are used include trucking, beverage, and retail.
