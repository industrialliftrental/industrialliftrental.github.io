Between a 45° forward tilt and a 15° rear tilt, the H Series forklift offers the most mast tilt in the industry, allowing operators to keep loads level on any terrain or slope. They are outfitted with an open operator window in order to lift operators up to warehouse racks and carry individual units of inventory.</p>
