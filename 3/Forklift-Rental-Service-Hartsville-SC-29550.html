Electric forklifts don't generate polluting emissions, and although they are usually the most expensive to buy, they are the cheapest in terms of operating costs.</p>

Ensure loads are stacked evenly on the forks before moving the pallet jack. ICE forklifts can handle loads of up to 15,500 pounds and are ideal for indoor operation on smooth floors.

The purpose of a lift axle is to place the vehicle's total weight over a broader area, thereby allowing the vehicle to meet weight-imposed restrictions on certain roads.</p>
<p>This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected. With so many advantages being offered by the electric forklift and electric reach stacker, it's clear to see why these pieces of equipment are increasing in popularity in the material handling industry.</p>
