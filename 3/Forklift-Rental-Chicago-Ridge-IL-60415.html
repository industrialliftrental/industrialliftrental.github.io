Also known as a straight mast forklift, the rough terrain forklift is designed specifically for outdoor job sites, especially on uneven surfaces.

Straddle trucks have longer forks than stand-up trucks and are used to carry long materials such as pipes, boards, and trees.</p>
<p>When it is necessary to omit the overhead guard, special attention should be given by the user and operator to conditions such as height and stability of loads and stacks, weight of individual units, and operating space including overhead obstructions. A forklift can overturn sideways if the center of gravity leaves the stability triangle on either of the two sides.</p>
<p>This enables a controlled lifting and elevating of the pallet. Rough terrain forklifts have counterbalances at the back of the truck that are calibrated carefully to avoid overbalancing issues.
