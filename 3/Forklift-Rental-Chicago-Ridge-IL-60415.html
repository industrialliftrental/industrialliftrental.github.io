<p>The arm allows the operator flexibility in picking up and placing loads (at various distances and lift heights) from the front of the machine. Also known as a straight mast forklift, the rough terrain forklift is designed specifically for outdoor job sites, especially on uneven surfaces. Be sure to find out what kind of warranty exists on the forklift. However, the term rough terrain‚Äù does not imply that the forklift can be safely operated on every conceivable type of terrain.</p>

Both available in two- and four-wheel-drive, the 6,000-pound-capacity RT706J and 8,000-pound-capacity RT708J models utilize an 80-hp John Deere 4045 diesel engine. Straddle trucks have longer forks than stand-up trucks and are used to carry long materials such as pipes, boards, and trees.</p>
<p>When it is necessary to omit the overhead guard, special attention should be given by the user and operator to conditions such as height and stability of loads and stacks, weight of individual units, and operating space including overhead obstructions. A forklift can overturn sideways if the center of gravity leaves the stability triangle on either of the two sides.</p>
<p>This enables a controlled lifting and elevating of the pallet. Rough terrain forklifts have counterbalances at the back of the truck that are calibrated carefully to avoid overbalancing issues. This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life.
