Counterbalance forklifts are what you most likely picture when you think of a forklift.</p>
<p>This is another semi-electric pallet jack truck you might want to check if you are seeking for such.

<p>Stand-up trucks are the most common and are often used where there's only one load per bay. Cargo type - You need to consider factors like the packaging of your cargo, the type of pallets used, and whether or not the load has a unique shape. The machine also provides a maximum load capacity of 5,000 pounds. Some of our forklift dealers carry rough terrain forklifts, telehandlers and scissor lifts.</p>
<p>Sideloaders are trucks that operate by picking up their load from the side and travel parallel to the length of the load, from the perspective of the operator. These IC forklifts are ideal for manufacturing plants and construction sites, where operators need versatility to handle multiple tasks and rugged reliability to navigate rough terrain, unpredictable weather and heavy loads.</p>
