They should also consider the environment in which they plan on doing most of their driving; if it's on paved ground, a less dramatic lift may be the better fit.</p>
<p>I notice two things right off the bat; one, the truck looks just about at home up there on that lift kit as it does on its stock ride height; and two, it hasn't seemed to have aged.
