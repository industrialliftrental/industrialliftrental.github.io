<p>While some may know forklifts primarily as a material handling appliance, there are in fact many different categories of forklifts. For starters, Crown's OnTrac Anti-Slip Traction Control on its narrow aisle reach trucks uses the forklift's on-board control system to determine whether the truck is losing traction. This is not always a terrible thing, but it often takes some getting used to, especially if you have driven the standard model and then change to a lifted truck.</p>

<h3>Forklift Truck Companies Phelan CA</h3>
<p>Truck owners appreciate the feeling of standing above the rest and a lifted truck will help you stand a little taller. Three-wheel counterbalance forklifts are very similar to the normal four-wheel counterbalance forklifts.

With the riding operator facing in the direction of travel, with the load trailing, clockwise movement of the steering tongue shall steer the truck clockwise.</p>
<p>Pro Comp offers a selection of lift kits for almost every major make and model truck or suv. This system is a result of the various types of forklift training available. On Low Lift and Nonelevating trucks the nameplate shall also show rated capacity. That also means you can take your lifted truck off the beaten path and drive it hard. Moreover, an optical sensor mounted on the load section can automatically lower pallets to an ideal working height.</p>
