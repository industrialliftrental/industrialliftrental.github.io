A "lifted truck" is a truck whose suspension has been modified to accommodate larger tires, usually 35 inches or bigger.</p>
<p>This is a testament to the impact that lift truck manufacturers and dealers have on the U.S. economy, says Johnson, and also the critical nature of operator training and safety in the context of the workplace. With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the high-level order picker when stopping and starting from the highest lift heights.</p>
