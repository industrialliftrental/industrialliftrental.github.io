Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities. Our wide range includes Standard Forks (540 mm), narrow forks (450 mm) wide forks (685 mm) super wide forks (800 mm, 1000 mm) short, long & super long forks (900 mm, 1150 mm, 1220 mm, 1500 mm, 1800 mm, 2500 mm) in minimum fork heights of 36 mm, 51 mm, 75 mm & 85 mm.

The compartment of the operator is found on top of and in front of the engine and the battery of the forklift. It's called a counterbalance forklift because the load that's being carried in the front is counterbalanced by a heavy weight mounted on the back of the vehicle.</p>

<p>Forklifts are essential to just about any job involving pallets, but they also cause the most physical injuries. There are also leveling kits that can be applied to a pickup, which raises just the front end of the truck so that it is level with the rear. This heavy-duty multidirectional reach truck is AC driven with clear-view masts, 360° steering and sideways battery exchange for optimized productivity.</p>
<p>There are plenty of lift kits available in the market that differ in terms of how much they can raise your pickup. This is exactly what this truck was meant to do. In a world full of pretty show ponies, it's encouraging to see trucks built to wreck shop, and there's nothing like the sound of a carbureted big block with straight headers.

However, suspension lift kits let the truck owners lift their truck as high as they want. Now, when there is no load present, the lift truck's center of gravity is firmly inside the triangle. The growth is driven by the increasing demand for battery-operated trucks and development of the warehouse segment across the region.</p>
