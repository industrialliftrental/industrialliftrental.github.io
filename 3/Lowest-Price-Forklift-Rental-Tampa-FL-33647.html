<p>If you love to go off-road, you might want to modify your truck's steering system with off-road lugs to keep your steering components more secure, but this can lead to problems when you're driving on paved roads, making it more difficult to steer and handle your truck in all kinds of situations. Make sure that the lifted truck has modified brakes with larger than normal rotors and calipers that are capable of stopping the truck in a reasonable distance.</p>
