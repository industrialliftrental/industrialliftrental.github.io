<p>It was fun driving different types of sit down forklifts. Side Loader forklifts have been popular in the past as they were the first forklift designed specifically for long load handling. Great customer service, I highly recommend the team at Damoli Forklifts. From the smallest, lightest loads in retail environments to the heaviest SKUs in the highest distribution centers, our trucks can handle any order picking application and help you get the most out of every operator, every shift, every day.</p>
