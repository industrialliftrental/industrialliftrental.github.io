Not work on a forklift platform unless the industrial lift truck is on a firm flat surface and the platform is equipped with guardrails or a travel restraint system or fall-arresting system.</p>
<p>It was fun driving different types of sit down forklifts. Side Loader forklifts have been popular in the past as they were the first forklift designed specifically for long load handling. Great customer service, I highly recommend the team at Damoli Forklifts.

Truck should be placed on an initially level test platform with the axis of the load wheels parallel to the tilting axis of the test platform. See below for more information on our counterbalance forklifts ranges.</p>
<p>The Raymond 5300 Orderpicker truck is the ultimate in order picking value. The 2X Series consists of two-wheel-steer models with lift capacities from 6,000 to 12,000 pounds, available in two- and four-wheel drive. This because a forklift's lifting capacity is affected by the dimensions of the load (especially load length), the lifting height, and the attachments used.</p>

Single-double forks - forks that in the closed position allow movement of a single pallet or platform but when separated, turn into a set of double forks that allow carrying two pallets side by side.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these rough terrain forklifts double as workhorses in the bush here in Australia. The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. While they can lift several times their weight, the maximum weight that they can hold is significantly lower than that of class 1 models. The catch is that you do have to test for various types of lift trucks.</p>
<p>Some forklifts offer climate control options to keep the driver comfortable in all types of weather. This lift truck is not suitable for general dock work such as loading and unloading trailers, case or piece picking and working in very narrow aisles that do not allow right angle stacking.
