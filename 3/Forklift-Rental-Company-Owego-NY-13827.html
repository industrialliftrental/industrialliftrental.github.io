The traditional model of the forklift stability triangle is useful, but it leaves out one important thing: three-dimensional space.

Improved off-roading ability, a better view of the road, and the ability to equip bigger wheels and tires for an outstanding look are just a few of those benefits. Forklift attachments, such as barrel clamps, fork extensions, rotators and personnel cages are covered under a separate unit standard (US10852).</p>
