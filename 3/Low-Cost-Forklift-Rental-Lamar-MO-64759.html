<p>Equipment Solutions for Your Short and Long-term Rental Needs. Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load at full rearward tilt of the mast and with the load elevated 12 inches from the floor, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
<p>These forklifts are known for what their name indicates, their ability to lift loads at a high altitude. Because of these possibilities, operators should be careful to keep the center of gravity firmly within the stability triangle. Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.</p>
<p>This is achieved by two outer legs which distribute the load weight and prevent the forklift from tipping. OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years. Technology makes today's RT forklifts safe, comfortable, and environmentally friendly.</p>
