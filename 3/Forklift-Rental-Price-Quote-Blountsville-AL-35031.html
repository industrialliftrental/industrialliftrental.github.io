<p>No matter your brand, the team at Nations Trucks has a lifted truck that's calling your name. It's not always in the budget to make capital investments like buying new or used forklifts for your material handling operations. However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift. The machine known as an orderpicker is an electric lift truck specifically designed for filling individual customer orders which require piece-part or case picking, rather than full pallets or unit loads.</p>
<p>Picking cases or single items from racks in a warehouse is the only job an order picker, a single-purpose lift truck, does. The following tests represent minimum stability requirements for order picker trucks with traction control on the lifting device, and not restrained by external means, having rated capacities up to and including 10,000 pounds at a 24 inch load center.</p>
