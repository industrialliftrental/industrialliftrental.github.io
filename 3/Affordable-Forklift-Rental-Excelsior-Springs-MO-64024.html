<p>The forks should be elevated until the point of intersection of the two carrying surfaces of the forks is elevated 12 inches from the rest platform to the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks. Knowing what types of lifts are installed in vehicles and identifying which one will serve you best will make your buying experience a pleasant one.</p>
