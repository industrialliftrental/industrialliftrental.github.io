<p>Forklifts generally fall into two categories: industrial and rough terrain. The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load-center dimension and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck. When the lift truck's center of gravity falls within the perimeter of this triangle, a load is safe to carry.</p>
<p>When using them in a warehouse, it is important to bear in mind that the lifting height of these forklifts is usually limited to 24.6 feet and that the normal working aisle adapted to these elements must provide 10.5 feet to 11.5 feet of free space.

<p>JCB RT forklift models include the 930, 940, and 950, respectively rated at 6,000, 8,000, and 10,000 pounds lift capacity. Although lifted trucks can make hitting the trail a lot easier, they do have some drawbacks that you want to keep in mind before committing to one. These models are known as hand trucks because they often don't require the worker to sit in a control seat.</p>
<p>Reality: the higher a heavy load is lifted, the less safe a forklift becomes. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. By applying air pressure to the lift axle, the driver is able to add one more axle into the equation and relieve some of the weight being supported by the other axles.</p>
