The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load-center dimension and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck.

Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. By applying air pressure to the lift axle, the driver is able to add one more axle into the equation and relieve some of the weight being supported by the other axles.</p>
