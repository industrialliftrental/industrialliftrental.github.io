<p>Our range of products include Order Picker Forklift and Forklift Truck. If it is only to be used for a handful of hours each week, you can safely settle for a used forklift that is ten to twelve years old, because you are likely to get another seven or eight years of useful service out of it. Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>
<p>To replace hydraulic pallet truck when under 300kg load.Pallet are simply lifted by pulling the handle backward, more efficient. Using the add-a-leaf will increase the height, but sometimes makes the suspension ride rough because of the added spring rate. Experience working in a warehouse or factory will be a bonus when applying for jobs as a forklift truck driver.</p>
<p>Class V forklifts are being majorly used in warehouses and distribution centers. While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour. The reach forklift is a warehouse truck used mainly for indoor work. We offer a sprawling inventory of used forklifts for sale.</p>

We have grown from a primarily used forklift warehouse to a fully functioning forklift dealership. We have forklifts that are capable of lifting at 20 feet, and we also rent Harlo and JCB 8,000-pound capacity rough terrain forklifts with the ability to reach up to 28 feet.</p>

The forks, supported by the two front wheels, are raised hydraulically to lift the pallet.
