Towering over most other folks on the road also provides a greater view into the distance, which is a plus when driving on regular roads and when off-roading. When off-roading, big lifted trucks must rebound after they jump in the air and make contact with the ground. With competitive rates, expert service, and lease terms to fit your needs, Indiana forklift rental has never been easier.</p>
<p>Four-wheel-drive is usually a selectable system designed to give better performance on broken terrain in low grip road conditions. 3-wheel lifts - used for pallet storage and other minor‚Äù tasks, this type of lift has a max load capacity of about 4,800 pounds. In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>
<p>The truck should be equipped with the attachment and the test load (when required) should be representative of the capacity of the truck and attachment combination. So if you need additional materials handling equipment to keep your business up and running, we can help. If you find anything wrong with the forklift during the walk-around or seated inspection, do not operate it until it has been repaired.</p>
<h2>New And Used Forklift And Lift Equipment Shelby </h2>
<p>There are a few different types of counterbalance forklifts. We take care of the maintenance of all of our rental forklifts for you. Ask what kind of lift it is, who installed it and if there have been any problems with it. Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies.</p>
<p>We provide learners with the skills and knowledge to correctly, safely and legally operate a range of Fork Trucks in the workplace.

These types of forklifts are designed to run on a variety of fuel types, the most common being liquid propane and diesel.</p>
