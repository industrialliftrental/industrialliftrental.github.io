<p>Start the forklift to both operate the mast as well as drive the forklift around. These types of powered industrial trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and have pneumatic (air filled) tires. Simply release or replenish air from the Air Lift air bags to make your ride smoother or to support a heavier load.

<p>These trucks are required for loading and unloading the materials and carrying it from one place to another.
