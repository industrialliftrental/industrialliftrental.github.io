The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight, which gives the extra 500 lb. capacity. We offer lifted trucks across a variety of models and trim levels, so no matter if you're shopping for a baseline full-size pickup or an upgraded heavy duty model, you can secure whichever you need with a lifted upgrade.</p>
<h2>Forklift Training Prices: Important Considerations in Hailey </h2>
<p>There are a few different types of counterbalance forklifts. We take care of the maintenance of all of our rental forklifts for you.
