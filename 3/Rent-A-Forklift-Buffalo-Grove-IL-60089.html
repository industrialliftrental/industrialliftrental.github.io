These trucks are very efficient in transporting heavy to very heavy materials from one place to another.</p>
<p>This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected. With so many advantages being offered by the electric forklift and electric reach stacker, it's clear to see why these pieces of equipment are increasing in popularity in the material handling industry.</p>
<p>Do not tow or push railway cars or trucks with a forklift. 35 inches or bigger is the common size range for determining whether or not a truck is truly a lifted truck. Add on a 6-inch lift kit and 35-inch tires on 20-inch wheels, and it's simply massive. An alternative to class 3s, tuggers can pull large loads without requiring the equipment to lift it off the ground to do it. This class is used on high traffic sites such as airport landing strips and luggage collection as they are easier to maneuver than a full forklift.</p>
