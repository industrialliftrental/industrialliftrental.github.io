<p>There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front. Turret Trucks are battery operated machines that use both the electric engine, battery and operator compartment to counterweigh heavy loads. Safety on and off the road is the foremost issue concerning all lifted vehicles.</p>
<p>This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected. With so many advantages being offered by the electric forklift and electric reach stacker, it's clear to see why these pieces of equipment are increasing in popularity in the material handling industry.</p>
