<p>Our forklifts are widely demanded by various industries like textile, warehouse, chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, aviation, glass, ceremics, construction, beverages, automobile OEM & its Ancillary unit. Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
<p>Rough Terrain Forklifts : Use: Primarily used outdoors where terrain may be rough. Class III type segment is expected to be the leading segment in Forklift Trucks Market during the forecast period.

At Radnes, we offer new and quality used forklifts out of Croydon, serving Surrey and Kent.</p>
<p>We understand that your business experiences unique circumstances and equipment needs, and our convenient rental plans are designed to match your unique circumstances. Pallet jacks may seem simple enough to use, but no employee should operate a pallet jack unless they have been trained on safe operation of the pallet jacks used in their current workplace. Forklifts, at maximum, can only travel 8 mph or 3 mph around people, but even at that speed, one of these 4-ton vehicle's steel tusks can puncture your machinery and shut down your operation.</p>

<p>With the test load supported by the forks in a normal and unrestrained manner, elevate the load to the maximum height at which unrestrained, horizontal travel is permitted. The lift truck industry experienced a host of new equipment innovations over the past year.
