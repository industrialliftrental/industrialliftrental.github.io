<p>The test load should be equivalent to an unrestrained, homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension and should equal in weight the rated capacity of the truck. Get the material handling equipment your business needs, on your schedule. Rough terrain forklifts have increased traction on the tyres for navigation over poor terrain.</p>
