<h2>Lifting & Material Handling Zuni </h2>
<p>If alternate capacities are shown for elevations lower than maximum, alternate capacities not shown may be 2 assumed to fall on a straight line between the capacity and the alternate capacities shown for each load center. Rated capacity of the truck must be visible by the operator. Lifting Pallets: The most popular way to put rough terrain forklifts to work is by lifting pallets.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load at maximum elevation shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a slope of 4 percent about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang. Contact used forklift dealers and other possible sellers.</p>

Whether your company deals with distribution and warehousing, or if you need to merely control your own stock, you will need to use the right equipment and machinery to help with the heavy lifting.
