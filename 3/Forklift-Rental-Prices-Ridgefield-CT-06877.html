<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment?

This point of suspension, of course, must be on centerline of truck and at a height above forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>
<p>Here we are talking about ways to improve your business with the help of a hand pallet truck. Safety for order-pickers who work around high-lift trucks is as important as safety for the drivers.
