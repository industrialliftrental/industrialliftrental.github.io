First, the fact that your forklift is rented means that you aren't solely responsible for its upkeep and maintenance. This type of truck, unlike Articulated Narrow Aisle Trucks, requires a high standard of floor flatness.

<p>Reach trucks are categorized as Class 2 lift trucks in material handling. The next huge advance in the forklift industry involved the electric engine. Electric forklifts are suited for indoor use and have several advantages. Forklifts help one person do the work of many when it comes to moving heavy pallets of goods inside a warehouse. Electric forklifts don't generate polluting emissions, and although they are usually the most expensive to buy, they are the cheapest in terms of operating costs.</p>
