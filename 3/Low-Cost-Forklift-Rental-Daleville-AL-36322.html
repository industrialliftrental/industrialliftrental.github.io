Suspension lifts are also found on a number of high performance sports cars, in which a very low ground clearance is used to improve handling, using an aerodynamic effect known as downforce; examples include the Ferrari 488, Lamborghini Huracan, McLaren 720S, and the second generation Ford GT. Such vehicles activate the suspension lift while traversing road bumps and ramps to avoid damaging the front underbody of the vehicle when driving on public roads; the suspension lift is deactivated on race tracks and level roads.</p>

Key parts like your brakes, suspension system, and tires will need to be refreshed more often than if you drove a non-lifted truck. This is ideal if you have multiple loads in one bay that you can access from different angles, as the truck can grab loads further back.</p>
