The pallet jack also features a durable sealed pump with overload safety system.</p>
<p>Whether you need to buy or rent a stand-up or sit-down forklift, Tynan Equipment Co. is here to help. Not only is the distance between the frame and body widened, but the leaf springs are recreated to actually lift the entire suspension. This is a person we would never invite to a party; a person whose lifted truck parked outside a restaurant we were considering would cause us to eat somewhere else.</p>
