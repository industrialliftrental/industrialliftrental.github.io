As mentioned in the preceding section, replacing or adding an attachment may reduce (down-rate) the safe lifting capacity of the forklift truck (See also General operations, below).</p>
<p>The articulated forklift is suited to narrow aisles and the loading or offloading of trucks. Sit-down forklifts are also more accessible to a wider pool of forklift operators for that reason. Test N5 - both reach and straddle trucks (except with tilting mast) - stability is usually obvious, in which case test may be waived.

The ETV 216i is more compact than conventional reach trucks, providing greater agility and improved ergonomics, giving the operator more freedom of movement and better all-round visibility.</p>
