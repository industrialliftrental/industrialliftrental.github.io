<p>Diamond now has separate websites for Equipment and Event Rentals. These electric-powered lift trucks are generally designed for sit-down operation, but standing models are also available. Reach forklifts are narrower than a typical forklift, allowing them to navigate in spaces their beefier brethren would dare not roam. These models have a bigger lift shaft and an increased tyre size on the front end to carry heavier loads.</p>
<p>If you are driving a forklift for the first time, one crucial thing to remember is that forklifts are steered by the rear wheels, unlike most cars. Do not alter or eliminate any forklift parts or add any forklift parts or add any accessories such as additional counterweight or lifting attachments unless approved by the manufacturer in writing. Lifted trucks draw attention from everyone on the road and act as giant billboards at local shows, putting that paintjob high up in the sky for everyone to see.</p>
<p>Service intervals of 1,000 operating hours mean that trucks operate reliably. Whether you're using the truck to commute to work every day or planning to carve your own path offroad, choosing the right lift kit is a crucial decision. Not all kits are created equal, and a rough-riding rig can add to fatigue on long trips, make controlling the vehicle exhausting, and put wear on the truck itself.</p>

<p>For electric lift trucks and batteries, you'll want to review the battery charger requirements. Remember, we also have used forklifts for sale and we also do forklift repairs and service. Our hand pallet trucks represent a cost-effective solution for many transport tasks involving short distances. But most warehouses are more sophisticated than that and require moving materials heavier and higher than a hand truck can go. They may use a fleet of forklifts, without any injury or accident to speak of.</p>
<p>High-quality, adjustable seating is important as forklift operators are sitting in their machines for hours at a time. They typically have pneumatic tyres that are larger than other types of forklifts and have maximum load capacities of between roughly 1,000 and 18,000 kilograms.

Your day-to-day duties will include unloading goods from trucks, ships or aircrafts, and moving them to the correct place.</p>
<p>Reality: the higher a heavy load is lifted, the less safe a forklift becomes. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. By applying air pressure to the lift axle, the driver is able to add one more axle into the equation and relieve some of the weight being supported by the other axles.</p>
