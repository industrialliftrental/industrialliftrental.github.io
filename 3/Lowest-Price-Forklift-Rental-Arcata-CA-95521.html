<p>JCB rough terrain forklifts are a reliable, comfortable, versatile and easy-to-use solution for any challenging rehandling environment. Train the Trainer” is a six-hour course in which I review OSHA regulations; how to evaluate an operator's performance during a driving test; and how to properly operate and maintain forklifts in terms of their controls, attachments, maintenance, rules of the road, and so on. I charge $175 per person, but similar programs can range anywhere from $150 to $600 per person.</p>

<p>AUSA Rough Terrain Forklifts are highly versatile machines capable of handling heavy loads and big volumes on rough and sloping terrain. You've seen the big ol' monster trucks on TV, laying waste to everything they drive over. Knowing your required lift height is equally important and will affect your unit's load-carrying capacity.
