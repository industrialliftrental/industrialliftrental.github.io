Due to its smaller forklift dimensions, the pallet jack is not capable of lifting heavy weight. Two or three forklifts are usually shipped on the same load to minimize the freight charges.

Pallet jacks can cost less than $500 and powered hand trucks less than $3,000.</p>

The Class I, Class II, and Class IV have a moderated growth rate over the forecast period as end-users are largely adopting Class III and Class V Forklift Trucks for the various applications.
