Lift trucks use either gasoline-powered engines, diesel engines, or electric motors, with the power supplied by a rechargable industrial battery. We carry new and used forklifts in every major make and model.</p>
<p>The main safety concern pertains to the lifted vehicle's bumper height from the ground. In addition to this, reach forklifts can be fitted with a camera that shows the driver what is happening above their head on a video screen. But palletisation really enhances the material handling efficiency and throughput. Rough terrain forklifts are larger, stronger and more durable and hence they are pricey than the average forklift.</p>

Every Hyster and Yale forklift that you rent from Gregory Poole has been carefully examined and certified by our expert technicians to be in great condition.</p>
<p>My "beater" 4WD has a 3" lift kit that gives it about a 10" minimum ground clearance-more than enough clearance to handle some quite nasty trails-but I actually use my 4WD for both work and pleasure in areas where such capability is a necessity. This is expected to drive the demand for warehousing, which in turn, will drive the global Pallet Trucks market in the coming years.</p>
