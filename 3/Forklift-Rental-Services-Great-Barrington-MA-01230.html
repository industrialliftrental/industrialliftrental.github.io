Year-end forklift truck sales of 260,180 included electric rider trucks (Class 1 and Class 2 combined), motorized hand trucks (Class 3) and internal combustion powered trucks (Class 4 and Class 5 combined). With the test load supported by the forks in a normal and unrestrained manner, the forks in fully retracted position (if retractable), and the mast at full rearward tilt permitted by the truck mechanism, elevate the load to its maximum height.</p>

<p>Hand-pallet trucks (aka pump trucks) are non-powered tools used to move palletised loads; typically up to 5500 lbs. Powered by energy efficient AC motors, the BT Reflex R-series and E-series of reach trucks are best suited to forklift applications involving high lifting with heavy loads.

<p>The forklift training material fit our training needs nicely. They're intended to be used for a specific set of tasks, and can only be used efficiently and safely by operators who have received proper counterbalance operator certification training. Back Rest: Attached to the carriage and prevents the load shifting backwards, it protects the mast cylinders hoses as well as preventing any goods falling through the mast and hitting the operator.</p>
<p>Masts are built based on the lifting height provided and can be: double, with two telescopic bodies that extend when lifting begins; double with full free lifting, in which, unlike for the previous type, the telescopic mast does not extend until the fork has been completely raised; and triple, with three telescopic bodies. The PTH Series hand pallet jack features solid construction and generous use of steel - especially at critical stress points - to deliver for long-lasting performance.</p>
<p>This pallet jack has a 3-function hand control (raise, neutral and lower) and offers a spring-loaded self-righting safety loop handle to enhance comfort and ease of operation. A lifted truck also has a higher resale value because of how valuable these trucks are. An overhead guard is intended to offer protection from the impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, etc., representative of the job application, but not to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load.</p>
<p>Overall Height Raised = The maximum extended height of the top of the load backrest or fork carriage of a completely extended mast. Many first-time lifted truck owners don't realize the ride penalty in going high. These forklifts travel at high and fast speeds. The frame, cab, boom, and body of a tele-scoping-boom rough terrain forklift are usually fabricated by the forklift manufacturer.</p>

Push the handle down to pump up the pallet jack, then let the handle come back using the mechanical spring.</p>
<p>A wide range of options allows you to adapt our order pickers to your own individual logistics profile. If low clearances are an issue, CASE offers freelift masts that allow you to raise the forks five feet off the ground prior to the mast protruding, keeping your overall travel height lower. Short-term requirements - If you only use the equipment to smooth out business operations during busy months or for a limited period, buying a forklift might be too costly.</p>

Regardless of the equipment you need, we're sure to have a unit and rental plan that is perfect for your needs.
