<p>Masts are built based on the lifting height provided and can be: double, with two telescopic bodies that extend when lifting begins; double with full free lifting, in which, unlike for the previous type, the telescopic mast does not extend until the fork has been completely raised; and triple, with three telescopic bodies. The PTH Series hand pallet jack features solid construction and generous use of steel - especially at critical stress points - to deliver for long-lasting performance.</p>
<p>Rugged construction and excellent pricing make this pallet truck the best value for your material handling needs.

Any time the forklift's center of gravity moves outside the stability triangle, the lift will tip over. Generally, the forklift's wheels and frame are designed for a specific tire type, so check the forklift's manual before going with a different tire type than what is recommended.</p>
<p>High-quality, adjustable seating is important as forklift operators are sitting in their machines for hours at a time. They typically have pneumatic tyres that are larger than other types of forklifts and have maximum load capacities of between roughly 1,000 and 18,000 kilograms.
