<p>With so many different types of forklifts , your workplace efficiency and productivity depends on selecting the right equipment for your needs. To use a forklift on a public road, the operator must obtain a forklift (F) endorsement on their driver licence Operators with a class 1 (car) licence and an F endorsement may only operate forklifts up to 18,000 kg gross laden weight, while those holding a class 2 (medium rigid) licence and an F endorsement can operate a forklift of any gross laden weight.</p>
