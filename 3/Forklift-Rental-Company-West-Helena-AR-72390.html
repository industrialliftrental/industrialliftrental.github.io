<p>Texas First Rentals will remain open during the COVID-19 outbreak to safely serve customers across our territory. Year-end forklift truck sales of 260,180 included electric rider trucks (Class 1 and Class 2 combined), motorized hand trucks (Class 3) and internal combustion powered trucks (Class 4 and Class 5 combined). With the test load supported by the forks in a normal and unrestrained manner, the forks in fully retracted position (if retractable), and the mast at full rearward tilt permitted by the truck mechanism, elevate the load to its maximum height.</p>
<p>There are many used forklifts for sale that have cross over features and at first glance look by all means to be the right choice for your job… only to find out later it wasn't. Included with the compressor will be a revolutionary "smart sensor" used to make sure your truck is always sitting at the proper ride height, regardless of what you are loading or towing.</p>
<p>A forklift that cannot tolerate the amount of weight or lift that weight to the proper height is not only a waste of time and money, but it is very dangerous. A forklift is a type of material handling lift that has two prongs attached to the front of it. These prongs look like a tuning fork and assist in the lifting of objects. The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly.</p>
