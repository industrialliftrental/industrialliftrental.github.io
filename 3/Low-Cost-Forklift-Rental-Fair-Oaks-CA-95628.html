According to a TICO representative, the materials handling equipment market as a whole continued to expand globally due mainly to increases in unit sales in Europe and North America as well as a recovery in China, although unit sales in Japan were on par with the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>These trucks are required for loading and unloading the materials and carrying it from one place to another. These drivers should not forego lifted trucks, but should consider a lower height that would accomplish their goal without exceeding what is necessary. To be fair, lifted trucks are not for everyone, however, and there are some drawbacks that go along with their advantages.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Industrial Truck Association (ITA), more than a quarter million units were sold, representing a 2.8% increase from 2017. These are just the most common types of forklift trucks. FMI provides an exclusive analysis of Global Pallet Trucks Market”.
