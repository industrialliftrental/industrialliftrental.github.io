Many models of rough terrain forklifts are also 4-wheel drive.</p>

<p>Narrow aisle storage systems provide more storage space, but require reach trucks and order pickers to operate in much narrower aisle widths.

A lift's forks offer the best evidence of how it was employed revealing if the machine was overloaded or abused during operation.</p>
<p>JCB RT forklift models include the 930, 940, and 950, respectively rated at 6,000, 8,000, and 10,000 pounds lift capacity. Although lifted trucks can make hitting the trail a lot easier, they do have some drawbacks that you want to keep in mind before committing to one.
