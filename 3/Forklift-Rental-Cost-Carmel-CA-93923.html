<p>A truck that has had its suspension modified so that it rides way too far off the ground, usually to the point where the high center of gravity could actually be dangerous. Electric forklifts produce zero emissions. Better ground clearance than Pneumatic Tire forklift. Deduct this weight from your forklift's capacity and you know how much you can safely load on your pallet. First off, as you might expect, lifting a truck is a fairly complex procedure.

<p>OUR PARTNERS - Business Dealership Between WL Forklift Specialists and Johnson Taylor Forklifts.
