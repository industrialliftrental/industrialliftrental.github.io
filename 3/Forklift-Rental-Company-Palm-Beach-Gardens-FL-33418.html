Like class 1 forklifts, class 2s are also battery-powered and are more optimally used within a warehouse rather than out in the shipping yard. Lifted truck up-fits are either for utility, such as enhancing your truck's capabilities and performance, or to improve its appearance.</p>
<p>We specialise in NZ forklifts including electric forklifts, VNA forklifts and used forklifts for sale.
