<p>Prominent & Leading Manufacturer from Pune, we offer battery operated pallet truck, battery reel lifter pallet truck and battery pallet truck. Rent diesel or LP-gas forklift or rent a specialized material handling forklift, such as a truck-mounted forklift or piggyback truck. At Cat® Lift Trucks we design and build counterbalance forklift trucks for every application. It is rumored that electric forklifts are maintenance free due to less moving parts and their cleaner environments. Additionally Pengate rentals offer the following advantages: low rates (which include batteries and chargers); rental rates may be expensible for tax purposes; maintenance service by our Raymond Certified Technicians at no added charge; the ability to opt into a rent-to-own program.</p>
