<p>Welcome to the home of Doosan Forklifts in the UK. Operating a rough terrain forklift exposes you to many hazards.

<p>You can rely on Westminster Lift Truck Services. On an F-150, one needs about a 4" lift to put on 35" diameter tires which is really the minimum for off road use here. As a further benefit, the mast of the electric forklift trucks is ideal for both racking and stacking and can reach lift heights ranging from 2300 to 7500 millimetres. Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks.</p>

The counterbalance forklift is a popular lift that features forks in the front and a weight in the back of the vehicle to counterbalance the weight of the load.</p>

This is expected to drive the demand for warehousing, which in turn, will drive the global Pallet Trucks market in the coming years.</p>
