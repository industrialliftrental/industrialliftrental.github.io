<p>Welcome to the home of Doosan Forklifts in the UK. Operating a rough terrain forklift exposes you to many hazards.

Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks.</p>
<h2>Reach Truck Harvey</h2>

The counterbalance forklift is a popular lift that features forks in the front and a weight in the back of the vehicle to counterbalance the weight of the load.</p>

If you decide you want to lift your truck, there are two ways to do it: either a body lift or a suspension lift.</p>
