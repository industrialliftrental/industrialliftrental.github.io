<p>The term fork lift refers to a variety of motor-powered trucks equipped with lifting forks that are used for loading, unloading, and organizing materials that are stacked on pallets or designed for lifting with forks. Category includes box trucks, maintenance trucks, forklifts, tow trucks, flatbed trucks, electric carts. Rough terrain forklifts, often known as telehandlers, are engineered for operation on some of the most extreme terrain and climatic conditions.</p>

Common uses for these types of forklifts run the gamut, including agriculture, oil refineries, construction, manufacturing, paper mills, and pipe yards.</p>
