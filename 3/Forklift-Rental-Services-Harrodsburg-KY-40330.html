The ability to floor-stack a product is based on the stability of the loaded pallet combined with the product's capacity to handle the weight without buckling on itself.">

<h3>Forklift Mechanic Harrodsburg KY</h3>
<p>One of the main safety risks for order pickers is falling from height when exiting the cabin onto pallets, partially enclosed platforms or racking. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test OP1, or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. Knowing your specific needs and what forklift type best fits your application is very important when renting equipment for your job site.</p>
<p>All depends on the make, model, type of forklift, and lifting capacity - in general, most standard 2-ton counterbalance forklifts cost a few hundred dollars per day to rent, and larger forklifts with bigger lifting capacities cost significantly more. If you decide you want to lift your truck, there are two ways to do it: either a body lift or a suspension lift.</p>
