<p>Welcome to the home of Doosan Forklifts in the UK. The Forklift Trucks Market in Asia Pacific is likely to witness the highest growth in the coming years. This increases road clearance and makes the vehicle appear to be larger than stock vehicles. Dealerships generally charge extra for forklifts that are returned with damage. Whether you need low level pickers, or turret truck pickers, you'll find the machine that best fits your needs below.</p>
<p>Look out for any uneven surfaces that could result in technical difficulties for the stability and longevity of your reach forklift. Lifted cars have the potential to run right over smaller vehicles in the event of a high-speed accident. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident, because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.</p>
<p>Mariotti, maker of some of the smallest forklifts on the market, has options that are ideal for tight spaces and unusual applications (need to get through a small doorway or into an elevator?) or weight-sensitive work spaces like an old factory. The dual-mode pantograph robotic reach truck is the first such model available in North America and joins Yale's well-established dual-mode robotic lift truck lineup.</p>
