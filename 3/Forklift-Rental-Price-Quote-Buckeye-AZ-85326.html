<p>Lift and travel speed- According to the company, the Crown RR 5700 travels seven percent faster, lifts 18 percent faster and lowers 16 percent faster than similar reach trucks. This is the leading cause of death involving lift trucks. Also called "piggyback" forklifts, they can be deployed anywhere they're needed to load and unload their "host" truck and trailer.</p>
<p>Reach Truck = A truck equipped with a pantograph-type reach mechanism that allows the forks to extend out past the supporting outriggers. Lifted trucks are never seen in New England, the New York area, the Miami area, or Hollywood.

You'll need to raise your truck a lot and put on improved suspension components (shocks, springs, etc.) if you're thinking of really going off-road. Also, it is very important that the driver of the lifted vehicle be aware of other vehicles around him or her when switching lanes, backing out, and entering small city roads.</p>
<p>A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features. This perk makes rough terrain forklifts ideal for busy construction sites with limited space.
