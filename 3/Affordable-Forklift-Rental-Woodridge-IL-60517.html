<p>We have access to many brands, so we will have a Forklift solution that fits your requirements. Each of these types of lift trucks have many configurations to meet the need of your specific application. Unfortunately, what are often seen running around the hard scrabble of suburbia are trucks with body lift kits. UniCarriers offers a wide range of equipment designed to fit all applications backed by the best limited warranty in the business. When you rent a lift truck, we'll be there to provide assistance with delivery, training and, if necessary, maintenance and service support.</p>
<p>These forklifts are known for what their name indicates, their ability to lift loads at a high altitude. Because of these possibilities, operators should be careful to keep the center of gravity firmly within the stability triangle. Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.</p>
<p>By comparison a moving mast reach forklift uses a hydraulic system of rails which enable the entire mast to move forwards. We offer long-term forklift rentals in California, Arizona, Washington, Oregon, and Nevada for fast delivery. If you have any other questions about counterbalance or reach forklifts or would like any advice regarding finding the ideal forklift for you, then please contact PHL today We offer support and have a huge range of stock to suit your every need.</p>
