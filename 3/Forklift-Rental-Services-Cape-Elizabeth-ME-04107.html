Collision hazards are a big concern for counterbalance forklifts. OSHA estimates that 110,000 forklift accidents take place every year at U.S. jobsites. Manufacturers of industrial trucks make a widespread contribution throughout the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>More custom shops are toying around with lengthened trucks on custom chassis or even military truck chassis to create one-of-a-kind builds that get rubber-necked more than a 10-car pileup. Designed to work in narrow aisles, the electric reach stacker can tilt both forwards and backwards for safer load handling. A body lift does not increase the clearance by a huge amount, other than by allowing for bigger tires that can help raise the underside.</p>
<p>According to U.S. government statistics, forklift-related accidents account for nearly 20,000 injuries and nearly 100 fatalities per year. Not all forklifts work the same, and many come equipped with different features.
