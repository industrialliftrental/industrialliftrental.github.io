<h2>How Power Pallet Trucks Are Changing With The Times Concord </h2>
<p>Counterbalance forklifts are a straightforward appliance that feature dual forks for heavy loads and bulky items.

As mentioned in the preceding section, replacing or adding an attachment may reduce (down-rate) the safe lifting capacity of the forklift truck (See also General operations, below).</p>
