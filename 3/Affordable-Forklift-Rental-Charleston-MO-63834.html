Because there is no load, the center of gravity is nearly in the center of the forklift's counterbalance. When you lift a truck or SUV, the lifting process typically involves adding new aftermarket performance parts such as brakes, shocks , bigger wheels , or tires to your truck.</p>

A body lift kit is installed by removing the body of a truck from its frame and installing blocks or spacers between the two, then reattaching the body to the frame. Electric forklifts are cheaper to operate as they cost less for fuel, require lower maintenance (having fewer moving parts), need less replacement of fluids and have considerably fewer lost hours from maintenance downtime and breakdown.</p>

Order pickers have a different steering control and they can turn sharper than a usual forklift.
