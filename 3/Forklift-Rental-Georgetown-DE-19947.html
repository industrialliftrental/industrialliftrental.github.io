<p>IN June, 1946, The American Society of Mechanical Engineers adopted a resolution to develop a safety code on powered industrial trucks. Rough terrain forklifts evolved from standard forklifts. A forklift rental can also be used for special projects and short term needs, without incurring long term costs and requiring unnecessary investment in equipment that may not be used all the time.</p>
<p>Standard forklifts generally measure between 4 to 7 ft wide and 8 to 10 ft long. Counterbalance forklifts are available in 4-wheel and 3-wheel configuration. Predicting how many lift trucks you're going to need on any given day is difficult to do.

Mainly for external use, the Toyota range of diesel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and gasoline (petrol) engine powered forklifts offers load capacities ranging from 1.0 to 16.0 tons.

When you hire these forklift trucks then they help you to enhance your business productivity. Never use a diesel engine, internal combustion gas, or propane powered lift truck models in confined spaces for long periods of time.</p>
