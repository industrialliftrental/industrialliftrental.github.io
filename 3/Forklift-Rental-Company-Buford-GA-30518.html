For starters, Crown's OnTrac Anti-Slip Traction Control on its narrow aisle reach trucks uses the forklift's on-board control system to determine whether the truck is losing traction.

<h3>Difference Between Forklifts Vs Pallet Jacks in Buford GA 30518</h3>
<p>Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels. Almost identical to the 6,000 lb. 4-wheel, the 6,500 lb. truck has a slightly heavier counterweight. The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it. The name comes from the counterweight in the rear of the vehicle.</p>
<p>With a broad range of capabilities, these forklifts can adapt to a variety of warehouse environments and are designed to help you run a faster, smoother operation. If working spaces are tight and pedestrians or other trucks may cross your path, the braking system of a pallet truck must function perfectly. Forklifts were first invented during early part of the 20th century and now had become a vital part of the modern-day industrial world.</p>
<p>The higher ride height also leaves a space cushion so anything underneath the truck doesn't get smashed on rocks. Lift Capacity: 12000 lbs.
