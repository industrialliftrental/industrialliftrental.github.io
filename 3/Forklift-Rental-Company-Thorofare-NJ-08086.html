<p>Our forklifts are widely demanded by various industries like textile, warehouse, chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, aviation, glass, ceremics, construction, beverages, automobile OEM & its Ancillary unit. Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.)
