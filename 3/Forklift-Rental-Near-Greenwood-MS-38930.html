<p>Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines. Rough terrain forklifts help your crew move materials, supplies, and workers safely.

Our pallet truck training course lasts for just one day and aims to give the learner all the necessary knowledge to safely operate pallet trucks.
