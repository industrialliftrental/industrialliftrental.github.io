If the upright malfunctions in any way or becomes stuck in a raised position, you should operate the lift control to eliminate slack chains and not attempt to reach into the upright to free the hang-up.</p>
<p>The forklift is every bit as good as they said it would be. I highly recommend this company. Speak to a rental specialist about forklift rental availability and pricing. With our extensive rental fleet and flexible terms for daily, weekly, monthly, and long-term rentals, we have a rental option to suit your needs.
