<p>JCB rough terrain forklifts are a reliable, comfortable, versatile and easy-to-use solution for any challenging rehandling environment. In a stand-up forklift, most often they require the use of a joystick which can present a learning curve to some operators. Our rental lift trucks are maintained to the industry's highest standards and undergo comprehensive pre-rental inspections to ensure consistent performance and reliable operations. Also for rent, sit-down, stand-on or walk-behind forklifts.</p>
<p>IN June, 1946, The American Society of Mechanical Engineers adopted a resolution to develop a safety code on powered industrial trucks. Rough terrain forklifts evolved from standard forklifts. A forklift rental can also be used for special projects and short term needs, without incurring long term costs and requiring unnecessary investment in equipment that may not be used all the time.</p>
<p>They offer numerous models that can suit any materials handling job. Toyota forklifts are designed and manufactured from the ground up with operator safety, comfort, productivity and efficiency in mind.

This is not always a terrible thing, but it often takes some getting used to, especially if you have driven the standard model and then change to a lifted truck.</p>
