Pallet jack - A forked vehicle for manual movement of a single pallet, similar to Class III trucks above, but with no power source for lifting or travel. Since load sizes typically change over time, you may want to buy a truck with more capacity than you need currently to make sure it gets the job done now and in the future.</p>

<p>Although trucks are rated at 24 inches load center, the load center for Test #N3 should be either 24 or 16 inches - whichever would produce the less stable condition. Handling material can be a very tedious and tiring process. The pump ''top-of-stroke'' hydraulic fluid bypass minimizes stress on the system when the load is raised to maximum lift height. Industrial Forklifts serve as very useful equipment at the construction sites, as it can be used to carry hefty building materials over long distances, across the rough terrain.</p>
