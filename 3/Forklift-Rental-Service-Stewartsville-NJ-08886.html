For one thing, any lifted truck has a higher center of gravity than it would as a standard factory model.</p>
<p>Only trained and authorized operators shall be permitted to operate a powered industrial truck. Variable-reach (or telehandler) forklifts are used to lift pallets or other objects to heights using a telescoping arm. Do not overload a lift truck.
