<p>The forklift is designed with a load limit for the forks which is decreased with fork elevation and undercutting of the load (i.e., when a load does not butt against the fork "L").

<p>These reliable reach trucks offer the operator the high-quality, comfortable and spacious position that makes the work safe and enjoyable. You'll need to raise your truck a lot and put on improved suspension components (shocks, springs, etc.) if you're thinking of really going off-road. Also, it is very important that the driver of the lifted vehicle be aware of other vehicles around him or her when switching lanes, backing out, and entering small city roads.</p>

Better off-roading performance. You can choose between a body lift kit, a suspension lift kit, and leveling lift kits.</p>
