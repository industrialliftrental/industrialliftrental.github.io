Internal Combustion Engine Powered Counterbalanced Forklift - comes in Stand on End Control, Stand on Center Control, and Sit Down Center Control, which is the the bread and butter of the industry. In some instances, RT forklift models are available with a choice of masts.

<p>Four-wheel-drive is usually a selectable system designed to give better performance on broken terrain in low grip road conditions. 3-wheel lifts - used for pallet storage and other minor” tasks, this type of lift has a max load capacity of about 4,800 pounds. In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, with the superior quality in ride characteristics of a system like the Range Rover air suspension and Lincoln Navigator airride, the one downfall is durability. Practical: Pre-Operational checks of forklift and working area, pre-operational checks of order picker and working area, negotiating hazards, shifting loads, placing loads in and out of racking, loading & unloading trucks and shut down procedures.</p>

Suspension lift kits can raise a truck higher than the 1-3 inches of a body kit, allowing for larger tires for on- or off-road adventures.</p>
<p>The rise in lifting heights also increases the specific requirements of forklift drivers, who have to deal with greater mast oscillation and restricted vision.
