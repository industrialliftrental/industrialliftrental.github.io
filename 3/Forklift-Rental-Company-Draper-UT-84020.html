Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.)

In addition to this, reach forklifts can be fitted with a camera that shows the driver what is happening above their head on a video screen. But palletisation really enhances the material handling efficiency and throughput. Rough terrain forklifts are larger, stronger and more durable and hence they are pricey than the average forklift.</p>
