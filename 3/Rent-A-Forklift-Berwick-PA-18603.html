<p>While gas forklift types do not need to charge and can operate day or night as long as they have enough fuel, battery operated forklifts need to be properly charged for up to eight hours to be used at maximum capacity.

Suspension lifts, particularly longarm kits, can require extensive modification to the vehicle and should only be installed by a skilled professional. Common uses for these types of forklifts run the gamut, including agriculture, oil refineries, construction, manufacturing, paper mills, and pipe yards.</p>
