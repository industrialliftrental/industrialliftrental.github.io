Designed to work in narrow aisles, the electric reach stacker can tilt both forwards and backwards for safer load handling. A body lift does not increase the clearance by a huge amount, other than by allowing for bigger tires that can help raise the underside.</p>
<p>For trucks with tilting masts the mast shall be vertical or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable.
