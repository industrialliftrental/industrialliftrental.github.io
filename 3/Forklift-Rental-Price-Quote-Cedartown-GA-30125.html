The reason that these trucks are ideally suited for off road driving is that the body of the truck is protected by the fact that it's several feet away from the ground, meaning that it's less likely to come into collision with the ground or other objects on the ground.</p>
<p>This is a testament to the impact that lift truck manufacturers and dealers have on the U.S. economy, says Johnson, and also the critical nature of operator training and safety in the context of the workplace.

Designed to work in narrow aisles, the electric reach stacker can tilt both forwards and backwards for safer load handling. A body lift does not increase the clearance by a huge amount, other than by allowing for bigger tires that can help raise the underside.</p>
<p>For trucks with tilting masts the mast shall be vertical or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. Additionally, the adoption of technologically advanced lift trucks will enable an increase in the lift trucks market size in the coming years. Trained forklift operators must know how to do the job safely, as demonstrated in a workplace evaluation. The mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets.</p>
