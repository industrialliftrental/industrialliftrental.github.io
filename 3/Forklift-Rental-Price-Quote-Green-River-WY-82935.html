<p>All forklifts are rated for loads at a specified maximum weight capacity. The 12,000 lb. electric is built on a larger frame than the 8,000 to 10,000 lb. trucks. For some businesses, hiring or renting forklifts makes more sense than buying it outright. In addition to a massive inventory and excellent customer service, United Rentals prides itself on over 100 locations in Canada.</p>
<p>As forklift operators need to sit in their machine for hours together, a high-quality adjustable seat is essential. Front suspension drop-down brackets, or a crossmember cradle, allow the vehicle's suspension pickup points to be relocated at a lower position, which allows the vehicle to be lifted without changing the suspension's travel and steering geometry.</p>
<p>For trucks with tilting forks, the forks should be horizontal or at full upward tilt, whichever is less stable. While on the subject of suspension lifts, torsion bar twisting is an inexpensive method many people use to lift their truck, which may be OK for leveling, but it is not a true lift because it merely adjusts the level at which the truck sits in its suspension travel.</p>
