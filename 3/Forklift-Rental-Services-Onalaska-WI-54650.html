<p>TYPES OF FORKLIFTS: fork crane models for industrial use within warehouses, hydraulic three-wheeled electric forklifts, etc. Whether it is while the order picker is moving up and down or during driving, the operator's entire body remains safely within the confines of the truck - aided, among other things, by compact steering and a generous cab area. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use.</p>
<p>Options and accessories available for this type of forklifts include a rail guidance, load-facing operator controls, a retractable tether, and an auto-locking pallet clamp. Every year nearly 100 workers are killed and 20,000 are seriously injured in forklift mishaps. Designed to work specifically indoors in tight access environments like high density warehousing, standup forklifts offer a number of efficiency enhancing features that are not available on the "general use" standard sit-down forklift.</p>
<p>This series includes lift trucks that can lift loads from 1 t to 8 t. The models are split into three categories, starting with the 1-3,5-t models. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. While you'll typically use a rough terrain forklift outdoors, some models can operate indoors. They may be a bit worn out, so when the lift is installed, the proposed 2 inch leaves may only have lifted the truck 1.5 inches.</p>
