First, the fact that your forklift is rented means that you aren't solely responsible for its upkeep and maintenance.

<p>This internal transport equipment makes loading and unloading more efficiently, which results in a more productive working day. The 3,500 lb. forklift uses the same body style as the 3,000 lb. The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight, which gives the extra 500 lb. capacity. We offer lifted trucks across a variety of models and trim levels, so no matter if you're shopping for a baseline full-size pickup or an upgraded heavy duty model, you can secure whichever you need with a lifted upgrade.</p>
