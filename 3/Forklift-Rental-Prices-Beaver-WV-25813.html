<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. 2WD rough terrain forklift has strong flexibility with 100% differential lock; 4WD rough terrain forklift adopts traditional technology while imported key components: DANA integrated trans-axle, Sauer Danfoss hydrostatic system, tilting cabin; 4WD compact rough terrain forklift palented self-designed axle &transmission, compact size meet with European standard.</p>
<p>In addition, lower costs of these trucks over conventional material handling equipment boosts their popularity in end-user industries. The powered pallet jack is generally moved by a throttle on the handle to move forward or in reverse and steered by swinging the handle in the intended direction. Material handling is an essential business. The 56 hp version feels underwhelming compared to some other forklifts such as the Caterpillar.</p>
<p>A forklift that cannot tolerate the amount of weight or lift that weight to the proper height is not only a waste of time and money, but it is very dangerous. A forklift is a type of material handling lift that has two prongs attached to the front of it. These prongs look like a tuning fork and assist in the lifting of objects. The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly.</p>
