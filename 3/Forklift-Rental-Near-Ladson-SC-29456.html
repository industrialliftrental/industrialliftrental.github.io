These forklifts come in two tire types: ICE pneumatic tires which are designed for outdoor use or indoors that have rough surfaces, and ICE cushion tires which are ideal for indoor spaces with concrete surfaces.</p>
<p>These reliable reach trucks offer the operator the high-quality, comfortable and spacious position that makes the work safe and enjoyable. You'll need to raise your truck a lot and put on improved suspension components (shocks, springs, etc.) if you're thinking of really going off-road. Also, it is very important that the driver of the lifted vehicle be aware of other vehicles around him or her when switching lanes, backing out, and entering small city roads.</p>
<p>For trucks with tilting forks, the forks should be horizontal or at full upward tilt, whichever is less stable. While on the subject of suspension lifts, torsion bar twisting is an inexpensive method many people use to lift their truck, which may be OK for leveling, but it is not a true lift because it merely adjusts the level at which the truck sits in its suspension travel.</p>
