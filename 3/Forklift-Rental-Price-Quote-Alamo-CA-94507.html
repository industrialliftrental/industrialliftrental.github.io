Internal combustion (IC) forklifts are powered by a traditional engine that runs on one of several types of fuel: compressed gasses or diesel. Rated capacity reduced for load centers greater than 24 in. and lift heights greater than 13 ft. Also, a strap or chain is used to attach the man basket to the carriage of the forklift.</p>

The handle shall be mounted in such manner that the operator will steer with his left hand when facing the load end of the truck. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift.
