<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. 2WD rough terrain forklift has strong flexibility with 100% differential lock; 4WD rough terrain forklift adopts traditional technology while imported key components: DANA integrated trans-axle, Sauer Danfoss hydrostatic system, tilting cabin; 4WD compact rough terrain forklift palented self-designed axle &transmission, compact size meet with European standard.</p>
<p>Reach trucks aren't meant for moving loads long distances. If you're unable to find a pre-made lifted truck in your area, or if these vehicles are too expensive for your budget, you may have more luck modifying a truck yourself. The Forklift Order Picker Cages have durable wire mesh backs and side panels and are to be used in conjunction with a body harness (for working at heights).</p>
<p>Linear speed control, an option on many competitors' trucks, is standard on all SP models and utilises a variable height sensor to measure platform height and determine the optimum speed level. Therefore, a truck's suspension has to be lifted and its components adjusted so everything fits and works well. Skilled forklift operators annually compete in obstacle and timed challenges at regional forklift rodeos.</p>

Third party organisations have developed de facto 'best practice' standards for forklift training, commonly referred to in the UK as a 'forklift licence', these are no longer recognised as proof of training as defined in the COP 117 (third edition) and as such training is not a legal requirement as is commonly believed.</p>
<p>The forklift is designed with a load limit for the forks which is decreased with fork elevation and undercutting of the load (i.e., when a load does not butt against the fork "L"). That's why many pallet trucks are barely wider than a pallet.
