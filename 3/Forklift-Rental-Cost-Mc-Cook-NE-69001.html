Rent diesel or LP-gas forklift or rent a specialized material handling forklift, such as a truck-mounted forklift or piggyback truck.

You can also hire our trucks for a longer fixed-term rental period, for up to 7 years. These features ensure that the machines can move safely on loose ground, rocky areas, and uneven terrain.
