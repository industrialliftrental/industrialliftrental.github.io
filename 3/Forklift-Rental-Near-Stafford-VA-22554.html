The machine also provides a maximum load capacity of 5,000 pounds. Some of our forklift dealers carry rough terrain forklifts, telehandlers and scissor lifts.</p>
<p>These lift trucks are meant to operate in narrow aisles and are best for storing and retrieving pallets in racks. Movement of the handle to the right shall steer the truck to the operator's right when moving the load foremost.

The rough terrain forklift dates back to about 1946 when a two-pronged lift attachment was placed on a power buggy or tractor chassis.</p>
