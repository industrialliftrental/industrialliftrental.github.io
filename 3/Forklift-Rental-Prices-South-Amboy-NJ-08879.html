<p>Our rental fleet has over 900 rentals ready for use at short notice. Lifted trucks have a negative reputation for being unsafe, but that's simply untrue. Any time the forklift's center of gravity moves outside the stability triangle, the lift will tip over. Generally, the forklift's wheels and frame are designed for a specific tire type, so check the forklift's manual before going with a different tire type than what is recommended.</p>
<p>Observe forklift operators in their daily work and take prompt corrective action to correct careless or unsafe operations. This is best if you have a large warehouse or need different types of lifts for the jobs you'll be doing. In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. We have a large selection of forklift parts for brands like Toyota, Clark, Hyster, Yale and more.</p>

However, industrial-grade masts do reportedly provide more substantial lifting capacity at height, with 6,000-lb and 8,000-lb capacity lifts serving as two popular examples among a number of rental houses.</p>
<p>There are two different ways that lift kits are designed, which dictates how they are installed and each one lifts the truck in a different way. Whether you're considering a lifted truck for work, pleasure, or both, there are some important benefits to think about as you get ready to decide what your next vehicle purchase should be. When your application requires the power of an internal combustion forklift, count on Crown to provide the right combination of strength, durability, operator comfort and application flexibility to meet your needs.</p>
