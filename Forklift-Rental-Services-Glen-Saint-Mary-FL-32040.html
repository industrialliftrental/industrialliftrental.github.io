<p>Compared to the internal combustion systems, the performance of AC trucks in parameters such as load-lift ability, ability to negotiate a ramp, acceleration, speed control on-ramps, and braking are gaining attraction of the industries. Because there is no load, the center of gravity is nearly in the center of the forklift's counterbalance.

A "lifted truck" is a truck whose suspension has been modified to accommodate larger tires, usually 35 inches or bigger.</p>
