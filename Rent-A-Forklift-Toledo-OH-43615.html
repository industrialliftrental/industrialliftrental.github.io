<p>These forklifts are best when you use the vehicle for a set time each day. The Class I, Class II, and Class IV have a moderated growth rate over the forecast period as end-users are largely adopting Class III and Class V Forklift Trucks for the various applications. The reason that these trucks are ideally suited for off road driving is that the body of the truck is protected by the fact that it's several feet away from the ground, meaning that it's less likely to come into collision with the ground or other objects on the ground.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with standard lift trucks, straight mast forklifts are essentially a cross between a forklift and an RTV. However, to maximize the benefits you can gain from a short-term forklift rental, you need to understand lift truck rental agreements and how they align to the needs of your specific business. The lifted suspension helps your truck better handle the rough nature of going off-road, plus the higher ground clearance means you won't bottom out as often.</p>

Electric counterbalanced truck shows that it has actually eclipsed the performance specifications of most internal combustion trucks. The test load should be equivalent to an unrestrained, homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension, and should equal in weight the rated capacity of the truck.</p>
