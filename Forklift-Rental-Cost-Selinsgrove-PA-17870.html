<h2>Lifting Operations And Lifting Equipment Selinsgrove </h2>
<p>With the test load supported by the forks in a normal and unrestrained manner, elevate the load to the maximum height at which unrestrained, horizontal travel is permitted. The lift truck industry experienced a host of new equipment innovations over the past year.

<p>No matter your application or your warehousing needs, we're sure to have a forklift truck that meets your requirements. One program is the World Industrial Trucks Statistics (WITS) which is published every month to the association memberships. For this reason, it is important to keep the center of gravity as near as possible to the center of the forks (remembering that the center of gravity may not be the geometric center if the load has irregular weight distribution).</p>

Better off-roading performance. You can choose between a body lift kit, a suspension lift kit, and leveling lift kits.</p>
