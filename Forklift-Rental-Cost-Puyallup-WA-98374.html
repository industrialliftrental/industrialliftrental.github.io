<p>Our range of products include Order Picker Forklift and Forklift Truck. If it is only to be used for a handful of hours each week, you can safely settle for a used forklift that is ten to twelve years old, because you are likely to get another seven or eight years of useful service out of it. Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>
<p>Look out for any uneven surfaces that could result in technical difficulties for the stability and longevity of your reach forklift. Lifted cars have the potential to run right over smaller vehicles in the event of a high-speed accident. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident, because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.</p>

Trucks are pushing such boundaries with lift kits these days that it's almost getting ridiculous to see guys actually climb into them.
