<p>That's because standing forklifts allow the operator to help move stock on and off the lift, and move around easily to navigate the tops of racks and mezzanines. And mud tires are important if you like to hit the trail after the rain and make a mess in your lifted truck. We employ highly trained, certified technicians at all of our 94 locations to service and maintain all of our rental equipment to the highest standards, either in our own workshops or on the job-site.</p>
<p>Counterbalanced forklifts are weighted at the rear to prevent the vehicle from tipping forward when lifting a load. Moving mast reach forklifts have a higher ground clearance due to larger wheels, but are unable to handle double deep racking responsibilities without a fork extension attachment.
