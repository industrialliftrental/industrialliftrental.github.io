<p>It was fun driving different types of sit down forklifts. Side Loader forklifts have been popular in the past as they were the first forklift designed specifically for long load handling. Great customer service, I highly recommend the team at Damoli Forklifts. From the smallest, lightest loads in retail environments to the heaviest SKUs in the highest distribution centers, our trucks can handle any order picking application and help you get the most out of every operator, every shift, every day.</p>
<p>When lifting a load, a reach truck moves the load back within the wheelbase, meaning less of the load is protruding from the reach truck. In the event of a crash with a lifted truck, the injuries can be extensive. We only sell forklifts that we are confident to be a great value for the condition it is in. Through our connections and many resources, we are always adding units to our inventory, giving you a wide selection of makes and models to suit the needs of your operation.</p>

A warning light must automatically activate when an order picker's platform is six feet or higher and the forklift is in motion. Like the pallets themselves, pallet jacks have become a lot more standardized in North America as of late. Also, note that loads longer than 48” will extend your load center beyond the standard rating of a 24” load center.</p>
<p>Constructed with either internal combustion engines or electric motors, reach trucks come in three main types: straddle reach trucks, standup reach trucks or double deep reach trucks. Besides the formalities of starting any business, a rental business has extra insurance liabilities. The controls of a forklift consist of a series of levers which open and close valves on the hydraulic cylinders.</p>
