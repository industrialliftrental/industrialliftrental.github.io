When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. While you'll typically use a rough terrain forklift outdoors, some models can operate indoors.

Leveling Lift Kit: This is the most affordable kind of lift kit and is best for those who just want to look bigger on the road, because they only lift the front end and don't offer a significant enhancement to off-road trail performance.
