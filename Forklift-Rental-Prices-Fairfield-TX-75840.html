Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that a line connecting the center of either load-wheel tire (or outermost tire where multiple tires are used) and the projection perpendicular to the platform of the point of intersection of the longitudinal centerline of the truck and the centerline of the steering wheels is parallel to the axis of the tilting of the platform, and with the steering wheel nearest the tilting axis parallel to the axis.</p>
