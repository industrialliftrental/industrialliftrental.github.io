<p>From new and used forklifts and compact construction equipment to rentals, repairs, and parts, we're your complete quality experts. Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that a line connecting the center of either load-wheel tire (or outermost tire where multiple tires are used) and the projection perpendicular to the platform of the point of intersection of the longitudinal centerline of the truck and the centerline of the steering wheels is parallel to the axis of the tilting of the platform, and with the steering wheel nearest the tilting axis parallel to the axis.</p>
<p>Whether you're looking to buy a new forklift, rent compact construction equipment, or service an existing machine, everything we do is rooted in the highest quality.

They also build gas, diesel, and electric engines for their forklifts. They have dual forks at the front of the truck and a weight in the back to offset the weight of the load in the front.

This function is limited to some (Class 2 & 3) Reach Trucks”. Frequency of use and pallet transport distance should be taken into consideration when choosing between manual and electric pallet trucks.</p>
