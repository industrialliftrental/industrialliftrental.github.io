<p>A manual pallet jack is a hand-powered jack most commonly seen in retail and personal warehousing operations. Stringent emission norms are driving the demand for electric forklifts. First, body lift kits are simple and straightforward in application and use. The big difference is on a Forklift, the operator stays in the cab of the machine at ground level and moves loads mechanically.</p>
<p>Double-Deep trucks are similar, but with longer forks, making them perfect for areas where multiple pallet loads are stored in each bay as they will reach right to the back of the bay. All of their forklifts have an excellent track record in terms of performance and safety. Do not pass under the raised portion of a forklift, regardless of the presence or absence of a load.</p>

<p>With proper care and maintenance, a lifted truck provides many benefits for the off-road adventure seeker. Outdoor or rough terrain forklifts can be greater than 10 ft in length. Renting a forklift requires almost as much forethought as buying one. The BT Levio R-series powered pallet truck range are perfect for long-distance handling of multiple loads.
