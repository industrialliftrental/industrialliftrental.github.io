<h2>Material Handling Lifts At Best Price In Kannapolis </h2>
<p>This entire class-leading range of hand pallet trucks has proven to be extremely durable and are therefore used in every industry. Forks can do many jobs, but they can't move loose ground or smaller materials. In order to be able to pick up heavy loads at the front, a forklift has to be even heavier at the back. The pallet jack also features a durable sealed pump with overload safety system.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load at maximum elevation shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a slope of 4 percent about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.
