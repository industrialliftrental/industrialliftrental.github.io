<p>Our forklifts are widely demanded by various industries like textile, warehouse, chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, aviation, glass, ceremics, construction, beverages, automobile OEM & its Ancillary unit. Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
<p>Whether you need to move or lift material - on solid ground or mud, rocks, hillsides, and other rough terrain - we have the reliable and rugged equipment to help you get your construction or industrial job done right. Repair or replacement - if your forklift breaks down at any time, we will repair or replace it normally within 2 to 3 hours, depending on your location.</p>
<p>These mobile, self-loading trucks are power-propelled to carry, push, pull, lift, stack or tier material. Reach trucks are used most in warehouses for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights. For example, additional viewing windows have been integrated for added safety and the control panel has been designed to be even more user-friendly.</p>

The 2X Series consists of two-wheel-steer models with lift capacities from 6,000 to 12,000 pounds, available in two- and four-wheel drive. This because a forklift's lifting capacity is affected by the dimensions of the load (especially load length), the lifting height, and the attachments used.</p>
<h2>Powered Lift Truck Newton</h2>
<p>For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. Forklifts have a wide range in their lift capacity, ranging from as little as 3,000 pounds to as much as 35,000 pounds or more. Fortunately, for those of us who love big trucks, there are many companies out there offering big-brake upgrade kits.</p>

Forklifts come in a variety of shapes and sizes to do various jobs. While forklifts in this class can also be used for a variety of tasks, they're generally more suited for picking up and putting away pallets of inventory.</p>
<p>A little more lifting capacity means the 3,500 lb. forklift can do more than the 3,000 lb. But you don't have to sacrifice the small footprint, as the truck sits on the same size frame. Trucks with electric steering include the Active Traction system with innovative hydraulics that adjusts the pressure on the traction tyre depending on loading conditions for faster travel speeds and better traction on ramps.</p>
