<p>Our forklifts are widely demanded by various industries like textile, warehouse, chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, aviation, glass, ceremics, construction, beverages, automobile OEM & its Ancillary unit. Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
<p>Whether you need to move or lift material - on solid ground or mud, rocks, hillsides, and other rough terrain - we have the reliable and rugged equipment to help you get your construction or industrial job done right. Repair or replacement - if your forklift breaks down at any time, we will repair or replace it normally within 2 to 3 hours, depending on your location.</p>
<p>These mobile, self-loading trucks are power-propelled to carry, push, pull, lift, stack or tier material. Reach trucks are used most in warehouses for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights. For example, additional viewing windows have been integrated for added safety and the control panel has been designed to be even more user-friendly.</p>

<p>These abilities made rough terrain forklifts vital on farms and construction sites. With over a quarter million units sold, forklift truck sales in 2018, in the North America market, continue their unprecedented increase.

The 2X Series consists of two-wheel-steer models with lift capacities from 6,000 to 12,000 pounds, available in two- and four-wheel drive. This because a forklift's lifting capacity is affected by the dimensions of the load (especially load length), the lifting height, and the attachments used.</p>
<h2>Powered Lift Truck Newton</h2>
<p>For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. Forklifts have a wide range in their lift capacity, ranging from as little as 3,000 pounds to as much as 35,000 pounds or more. Fortunately, for those of us who love big trucks, there are many companies out there offering big-brake upgrade kits.</p>
