The handle shall be mounted in such manner that the operator will steer with his left hand when facing the load end of the truck. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Since washing a lifted truck also involves washing tires (and pretty massive ones sometimes), I would recommend using a handheld tire brush like the one pictured above for rubber sidewalls.</p>

The offered trucks are utilized for various material handling applications in a host of industries.

Of course there will be a rental charge for the use of the truck, battery, charger and attachment.</p>
<p>Standard Hand Hydraulic High Lift Pallet Truck is fabricated using fine grade raw materials and advanced technology. Keep in mind that body lifting can only raise vehicles from 1 to 3 inches total, which means you cannot get a huge lift from these kits. Always start the engine while seated in the operator's position‚Äînever while standing alongside the forklift.</p>
