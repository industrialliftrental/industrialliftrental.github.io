<p>Diamond now has separate websites for Equipment and Event Rentals. Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>IN June, 1946, The American Society of Mechanical Engineers adopted a resolution to develop a safety code on powered industrial trucks. Rough terrain forklifts evolved from standard forklifts. A forklift rental can also be used for special projects and short term needs, without incurring long term costs and requiring unnecessary investment in equipment that may not be used all the time.</p>
<p>All types and sizes, perfect for any need, including warehouse, material handling, outdoor and rough terrain. Designed to push through the toughest work days, these forklifts offer dependable performance and rugged durability in heavy-duty outdoor applications. Despite being used, all of our rough terrain forklifts are of a high standard. A reach truck looks like a very small type of counterbalance forklift.</p>
