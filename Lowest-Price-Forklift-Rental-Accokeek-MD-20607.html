<p>Our range of products include Order Picker Forklift and Forklift Truck. If it is only to be used for a handful of hours each week, you can safely settle for a used forklift that is ten to twelve years old, because you are likely to get another seven or eight years of useful service out of it. Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>

If you're renting with inside or warehouse work in mind, a Narrow Aisle Truck is the way to go for spaces under ten feet. Lift kits can put added pressure on the driveshaft angles , causing intense vibrations at peak speeds.</p>

Our AC Orderpicker trucks use fewer amps per cycle, so you'll save on batteries, chargers and downtime. Check the areas around and behind your vehicle before putting it in reverse, even if that means you need to temporarily turn the truck off, hop down out of the driver's seat and do a quick check for any children or pedestrians in the area.</p>

<p>Masts are built based on the lifting height provided and can be: double, with two telescopic bodies that extend when lifting begins; double with full free lifting, in which, unlike for the previous type, the telescopic mast does not extend until the fork has been completely raised; and triple, with three telescopic bodies. The PTH Series hand pallet jack features solid construction and generous use of steel - especially at critical stress points - to deliver for long-lasting performance.</p>
