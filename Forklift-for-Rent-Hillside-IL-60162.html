<p>Diamond now has separate websites for Equipment and Event Rentals. Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>For anyone interested in some serious off-roading, lifted trucks can be a great way to take your experience to the next level and conquer all-new trails. For body lift kits you don't get additional ground clearance, but it's a good choice if you're consistently driving on highways and streets because it adds lift without sacrificing handling, steering, or ride comfort.</p>
<p>For pallet jacks that can weigh for dual efficiency, contact METTLER TOLEDO. We recommend this pallet jack due to its' heavy duty structure and its affordability. They also build gas, diesel, and electric engines for their forklifts. They have dual forks at the front of the truck and a weight in the back to offset the weight of the load in the front. It is the highest capacity stockpicker in the line, handling heavy palletized loads at heights up to 366 inches.</p>

<p>This can occur if the forklift has loads that are over its designed capacity. The two basic types of lift kit are body lift and suspension lift. Please do not hesitate to give us a call, or send us an inquiry, and we'd be happy to help you find the right forklift for your business. Renting equipment provides a fixed monthly cost that can be written off as an operating expense, allowing you to stabilize your operating budget.</p>
<p>These trucks are required for loading and unloading the materials and carrying it from one place to another. These drivers should not forego lifted trucks, but should consider a lower height that would accomplish their goal without exceeding what is necessary. To be fair, lifted trucks are not for everyone, however, and there are some drawbacks that go along with their advantages.</p>
<p>The hand pallet truck lift offers load shifting, lifting and lowering functions. Popular types are high-lift fork truck, high-lift ram truck, high-lift boom truck, high-lift clamp truck, and high-lift platform truck (Fig. Sales, Service and Rental of construction equipment including, Genie Aerial Lifts and Haulotte Scissor lifts and Man lifts are also among our equipment offerings.</p>
