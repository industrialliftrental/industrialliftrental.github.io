Tuff Country EZ-Ride Suspension has been making lift kits for over 20 years.

Because the dimensions of the machine, its weight, the counterbalance, and other elements will define the nominal load that the forklift can handle and lift. An additional set of wheels allows pallet truck to be moved sideways in addition to being the conventional forward and back directions.</p>
