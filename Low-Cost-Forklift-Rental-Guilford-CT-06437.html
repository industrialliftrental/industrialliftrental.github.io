<h3>Hand Pallet Truck  Guilford CT 06437</h3>
<p>A lifted truck can provide you with greater ground clearance beneath your truck, even if you choose a simple lift kit, which can help you with going off-road with your pickup. Note that this classification refers to commonly-used vehicles and does not include all powered industrial trucks covered by the OSHA standard.

<p>These reliable reach trucks offer the operator the high-quality, comfortable and spacious position that makes the work safe and enjoyable. You'll need to raise your truck a lot and put on improved suspension components (shocks, springs, etc.) if you're thinking of really going off-road. Also, it is very important that the driver of the lifted vehicle be aware of other vehicles around him or her when switching lanes, backing out, and entering small city roads.</p>
<p>We understand that determining the best used forklift for your specific needs is difficult. Key parts like your brakes, suspension system, and tires will need to be refreshed more often than if you drove a non-lifted truck. This is ideal if you have multiple loads in one bay that you can access from different angles, as the truck can grab loads further back.</p>
