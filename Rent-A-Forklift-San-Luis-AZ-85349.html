<p>Industrial counterbalance forklifts are the most common trucks used in indoor warehouses and stores. Angled lower backrest provides the operator with a clear view of the fork tips, which makes it easier for the operator to insert the forks into a pallet. Rough terrain forklifts typically have rugged tyres and feature heavy-duty construction. Trucks may be of the reaching or non-reaching type, equipped with tilting mast, or forks that tilt alone without tilting mast, or without any form of mast or fork tilt.</p>
<p>Look out for any uneven surfaces that could result in technical difficulties for the stability and longevity of your reach forklift. Lifted cars have the potential to run right over smaller vehicles in the event of a high-speed accident. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident, because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.</p>
