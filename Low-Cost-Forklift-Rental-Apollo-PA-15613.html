<p>With so many different types of forklifts , your workplace efficiency and productivity depends on selecting the right equipment for your needs. To use a forklift on a public road, the operator must obtain a forklift (F) endorsement on their driver licence Operators with a class 1 (car) licence and an F endorsement may only operate forklifts up to 18,000 kg gross laden weight, while those holding a class 2 (medium rigid) licence and an F endorsement can operate a forklift of any gross laden weight.</p>
<p>There are plenty of things to consider about how your truck will change after it's lifted. A walk-behind narrow aisle lift truck with a 3,000 to 4,000 pound capacity costs approximately $15,000 to $18,000. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida.</p>
<p>They generally have a more limited range of types of rental equipment.

When standard pallet sizes launched in 1930, forklifts became even more useful. Simple does not mean you should try to install this kind of lift kit yourself, however, unless you have a lot of experience with working on truck frames and bodies and the right equipment to do it safely.</p>
<p>The counterbalance” term refers to the weight distribution for cargo loads; any pallets or merchandise are counterbalanced against the weight of the machine. What makes forklifts different. Many countries and regions require fork lift operator training and, in some cases, a fork lift operator license, due to the potentially dangerous nature of the work and the high value of merchandise handled by lifts.</p>
