<p>TYPES OF FORKLIFTS: fork crane models for industrial use within warehouses, hydraulic three-wheeled electric forklifts, etc. Whether it is while the order picker is moving up and down or during driving, the operator's entire body remains safely within the confines of the truck - aided, among other things, by compact steering and a generous cab area. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use.</p>
<p>The forks should be elevated until the point of intersection of the two carrying surfaces of the forks is elevated 12 inches from the rest platform to the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks. Knowing what types of lifts are installed in vehicles and identifying which one will serve you best will make your buying experience a pleasant one.</p>
<p>By using the know-how gained from years of experience in production of industrial vehicles and the latest technologies, Komatsu markets a variety of lift trucks, including small-to large-sized engine-powered lift trucks, battery-powered lift trucks, and HST-drive lift trucks. In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation.</p>

The unique dock-to-stock capability of the Toyota Stand-Up Rider Forklift makes it top of its class and one of the most versatile forklifts in Toyota's product line.</p>
