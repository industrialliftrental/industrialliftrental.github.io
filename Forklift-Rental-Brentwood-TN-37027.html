<p>The Raymond 5300 Orderpicker truck is the ultimate in order picking value. The 2X Series consists of two-wheel-steer models with lift capacities from 6,000 to 12,000 pounds, available in two- and four-wheel drive. This because a forklift's lifting capacity is affected by the dimensions of the load (especially load length), the lifting height, and the attachments used.</p>
<h2>Reach Fork Truck Brentwood</h2>
<p>With our electric reach trucks, you will enjoy a number of technical and ergonomic benefits. The operator essentially is lifted or lowered to the stock position with the load in order to get access to the product.
