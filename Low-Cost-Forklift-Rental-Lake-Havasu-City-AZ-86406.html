<p>Quality parts for all lift trucks and all lift truck needs. Reaping those benefits, however, requires an array of skills and knowledge to operate these vehicles responsibly on siteâ€”skills and knowledge that have to be validated, either by third-party safety trainers, like myself, or by individuals who have attended training-the-trainer-type classes (more on this below), or by the vendors renting the equipment.</p>
<p>To help you tackle any terrain you want in your RAM Stealth, the conversions begin with a 6-inch Rocky Ridge Suspension Lift Kit. Class seven forklifts utilize large floatation type tires for use outdoors on difficult services. If the forklift's mast doesn't provide enough reach, a tower can add a few extra feet.
