Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load at full rearward tilt of the mast and with the load elevated 12 inches from the floor, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Crown introduced a new 2-stage TL mast , commonly referred to as a Truckers Mast,” for its Crown FC 5200 Series counterbalance forklifts and the pneumatic and cushion tire models of the Crown C-5 Series industrial forklifts. Some small work zones and warehouses require a compact-sized forklift for safe maneuvering and material handling, while more demanding loads require a heavy-duty model designed for maximum lifting power or extra height.</p>
<p>These mobile, self-loading trucks are power-propelled to carry, push, pull, lift, stack or tier material. Reach trucks are used most in warehouses for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights. For example, additional viewing windows have been integrated for added safety and the control panel has been designed to be even more user-friendly.</p>

Collision hazards are a big concern for counterbalance forklifts. OSHA estimates that 110,000 forklift accidents take place every year at U.S. jobsites. Manufacturers of industrial trucks make a widespread contribution throughout the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>What's unique about this type of forklift is that the mast can turn left or right independent of the body of the truck. Of course, Chevrolet already produces a number of fantastic off-road trucks with dedicated trims designed to take on a wide range of trails out there. Common industries that use these types of forklifts include lumber yards, metal yards, and shipping ports.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many lift kits and the companies that sell and install them, fail to educate consumers about the differences in their vehicle's handling that can impact safety behind the wheel. According to U.S.government statistics, forklift-related accidents account for nearly 20,000 injuries and nearly 100 fatalities per year.
