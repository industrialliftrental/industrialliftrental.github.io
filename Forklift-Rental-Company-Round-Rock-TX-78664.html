<p>This type of lift is more expensive than a body lift and requires making changes to the mechanical system or suspension of the truck. REACH TRUCK: A self-loading truck, generally high-lift, having load-engaging means mounted so it can be extended forwardly under control to permit a load to be picked up and deposited in the extended position and transported in the retracted position (Fig.</p>

<h3>Telescopic Forklift Round Rock TX</h3>
<p>The outstanding performance of the hydrostatic transmission with the connectable 4WD FullGrip® allows the easy carry of loads on the toughest grounds and narrow places.

The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck.

Almost identical to the 6,000 lb. 4-wheel, the 6,500 lb. truck has a slightly heavier counterweight. The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it.
