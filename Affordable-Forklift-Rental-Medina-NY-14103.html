<p>JCB rough terrain forklifts are a reliable, comfortable, versatile and easy-to-use solution for any challenging rehandling environment. In a stand-up forklift, most often they require the use of a joystick which can present a learning curve to some operators. Our rental lift trucks are maintained to the industry's highest standards and undergo comprehensive pre-rental inspections to ensure consistent performance and reliable operations. Also for rent, sit-down, stand-on or walk-behind forklifts.</p>
<p>For anyone interested in some serious off-roading, lifted trucks can be a great way to take your experience to the next level and conquer all-new trails. For body lift kits you don't get additional ground clearance, but it's a good choice if you're consistently driving on highways and streets because it adds lift without sacrificing handling, steering, or ride comfort.</p>
<p>Lift & place 3 loads onto truck bed (75mm tolerance) and remove upon completion. Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position. This means the lift truck doesn't have to face the shelves—it can drive straight while still picking up loads to the side.</p>
